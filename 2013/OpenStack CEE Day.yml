    RDO is a community supported distribution of the latest releases of
    OpenStack for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its clones like CentOS and
    Scientific Linux. We also distribute packages of the latest release of
    OpenStack for Fedora. Through a Red Hat developed tool called PackStack,
    we have made the installation and configuration process quick and easy.
    You can go from a bare operating system to a running instance in as
    little as 15 to 20 minutes.

    Come and hear about this distribution, and about Red Hat's work in the
    OpenStack project.
