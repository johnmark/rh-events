- title: Using Personas to Target Users
  speaker: Dave Neary
  start: 2013-04-15 09:50 PDT

    Personas were made famous by Alan Moore in "The Inmates are Running the
    Asylum," a seminal book on user interface design for computer
    programmers. They have been used for decades in the marketing industry,
    in user experience design, and in product planning to help target
    specific market segments with features, ads, and product design.

    Personas help you frame feature discussions while developing your
    software, guide your communication and event strategy, and ultimately
    help you to have a more popular, better project. As the OpenStack
    project evolves beyond its original base and seeks to engage with a
    broader user community, understanding the profile of OpenStack users
    becomes critical in increasing participation and thus improving the
    project.

    This session will cover the basics of: \* What is a persona and why
    should I care? \* How do I come up with persona(s) for my project? \*
    What can I do with personas?

    This session will be useful to those interested in better understanding
    their target audiences, and specifically those seeking to grow a
    community around an open source project.

    RedHat has created it's own OpenStack distribution that is now in
    preview and still a bit rough around the edges, but promises to include
    what is needed to deploy & evaluate a truly & complete Open Cloud
    environment. In addition, Red Hat wants there to be a widely used
    open-source community developed PaaS model for the cloud which includes
    being open to participation by a community of peers.

    To really create a open cloud environment and to make it useful, you
    need to complete the stack with an PaaS. Just getting a cloud
    environment up and running is no longer enough. The challenge that
    OpenStack faces is how to get people, applications and services working
    on OpenStack out of the box.

    One approach to the problem is to combining all the necessary pieces
    that go into building an OpenStack cloud (compute, storage, networking,
    management) with a platform as a service (PaaS) into your OpenStack
    distribution.

    OpenShift Origin project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, a
    permissive and widely-used open source license, which was selected so
    that the code would be available for use by the broadest range of

    individuals and organizations. This is the same license chosen by the
    OpenStack project, for much the same reason. This license is already
    well known and understood by individuals and organizations already
    involved in cloud computing and in enterprise scale open source
    development.

    In this session, I'll discuss RedHat's efforts with OpenStack, Fedora, &
    OpenShift Origin to create a more complete OpenStack distribution. Our
    community initiatives to ensure Origin easily and seamlessly integrates
    on any OpenStack distribution and how to you can add Origin into your
    own OpenStack distributions.

    Charles Babbage's Difference Engine amazed Ada Lovelace with its
    unprecedented engineering feats just like OpenStack amazes people today.
    We have some stories to share about learning, exploring new territory
    and making new connections. This story is about newcomers working on
    OpenStack as interns. Three were in the GNOME Outreach Program for Women
    from January to March. One has been an intern twice at two different
    OpenStack companies.

    For the Outreach Program for Women, three mentors worked with interns;
    one from the Image service (glance) project, one from the Dashboard
    (horizon) project, and one from the documentation project. For the
    company internships, mentors at the company worked with the intern. We
    want to share their stories so you can learn about our current OpenStack
    internships and future plans for such programs. We will talk about what
    they worked on while interning, what struggles they faced while learning
    everything about OpenStack, and where they want to go from here. We can
    provide metrics that show the impact of involving women in Open Source,
    and metrics about the impact these interns have on the projects. We want
    to describe the future vision for internship programs based on the
    lessons learned recently.

    If you are an organization looking to hire OpenStack interns, or a
    potential intern seeking an internship, this session is for you.

- title: Securing OpenStack with FreeIPA

    Security is important when deploying any distributed application
    especially the one responsible for running all of the virtual machines
    in your data center. When deploying Open Stack, many of the security
    implementation details are left unspecified. This is where FreeIPA comes
    to the rescue. This session will show how guidance on how FreeIPA can be
    used to help secure communication, provide authentication and
    authorization capabilities for a large scale Open Stack deployment.

- title: Apache Deltacloud - speaking EC2 and CIMI to Nova
  speaker: David Lutterkort

    Since its inception in 2009, Deltacloud has been focussed on bridging
    the gaps between various IaaS cloud API's by offering a RESTful API that
    can be used against various backend clouds. Over time, the project has
    been expanded to include frontends for Amazon's EC2 API and DMTF's CIMI.

    This talk will provide an overview of what Deltacloud is, what the
    supported frontends and backends are, and how to use it with Openstack.
    It will also explain how Deltacloud is used be a number of projects to
    achieve cross-cloud portability.
