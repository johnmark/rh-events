    The best free software hackers are great at the "soft skills" related to
    hacking - resolving conflict, gathering support around a direction for
    the project, and understanding what the user _really_ wants when filing
    a bug report. Every feature request and implementation discussion, bug
    report and mailing list thread is a negotiation.

    There is a well established, common sense, very effective way to think
    of negotiations which will help you improve as a developer, and make
    your project better at the same time, from the Harvard Negotiation
    Project. In this talk, Dave Neary will provide an overview of
    negotiation theory and pointers to further resources. He will also
    explore the importance of _both_ empathy and transparency in our
    communications as we look to make our free software project communities
    most successful.

    Buzz of the season, the cloud is seen by all as a revolution but also as
    a dubious marketing scheme. Words like SaaS, IaaS appeared, changing the
    way we see IT since a few years. But even with that, everything is still
    a bit foggy for lots of IT specialist.

    With the example of Openshift Origin, a free and open PaaS system (
    platform as a service ), we will explore what hide behind this type of
    architecture, how it differ from a more classical hosting, how
    everything wrok together, and what this can bring to your life of coders
    and sysadmins.
