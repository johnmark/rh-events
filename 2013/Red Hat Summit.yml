    Red Hat products are built on open source software. Unlike proprietery
    software, open source software provides the freedom to use, modify, and
    redistribute the code, giving customers an opportunity to engage in the
    product development process and preview future Red Hat products.

    In this session, Dave Neary will discuss community projects that Red Hat
    has sponsored and participated in, including oVirt, OpenStack, JBoss
    Application Server, LibreOffice, GNOME, and Fedora. Attendees will:

    * Discover the benefits of using community-developed software and
    engaging with upstream communities
    * Learn about how French services company AlterWay built a public cloud
    offering on oVirt
    * Preview upcoming Red Hat product features
    * Learn about how to influence the development of future features by
    working directly with the developers
