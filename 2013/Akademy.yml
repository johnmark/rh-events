    KScreen is new software for multiple screen management in KDE. It
    automates switching between multiple monitor configurations. No more
    manual configuration is needed when a new monitor is plugged in — and no
    more windows are left on disconnected screens.

    In this lightning talk Daniel will quickly introduce KScreen and its
    features and will peek into future of the project.
