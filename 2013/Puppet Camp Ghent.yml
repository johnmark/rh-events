- title: Replacing that growing "exec" with a provider
  speaker: Dominic Cleal
  start: 2013-01-31 17:00 CET
  end: 2013-01-31 17:45 CET

    Far too often we abuse the "exec" type, when what we really need is a
    simple provider that allows for more complex tests and exception
    handling. This talk will show how to change that enormous "exec"
    resource to a new type and provider, then return your manifests to a
    declarative config description.
