    The SMB protocol is, and always has been, an extension of the Operating
    Systems and File Systems on which it was designed to run. Yes, that
    means DOS/FAT, OS2/HPFS, and Windows/NTFS. Building an SMB server on any
    other platform requires a lot of special handling, sort of like the
    special pounding of a square peg into a round hole with a finely tuned
    sledgehammer. The design of many newer file systems, particularly
    object, cluster, and distributed storage systems, complicates matters
    even more by "relaxing" adherence to standard semantics. This
    presentation will highlight a number of ways in which these "relaxed
    fit" file systems clash with SMB expectations, and will provide some
    examples of ways to bridge the gap.

    Learning Objectives:

    * Problems to look for when integrating SMB with a Distributed File
    System.
    * SMB integration problem solving approaches.
    * The importance of itemizing integration SMB problems.
