    Some of the best speakers in open source will again attend and
    participate – in a boutique, personal environment.

    We’ll focus specifically on developers, system administrators and IT
    managers. If you do any of this you’ll find excellent information in a
    session or training format.

    We’ll focus on established technologies and topics, like Linux, Drupal,
    MySQL, LibreOffice, Security, Virtualization, Licensing and Patents.

    We’ll focus on emerging technologies like Riak, MongoDB, Software
    Defined Networking, JavaScript, backbone.js, Python, Clojure, Couchbase
    and HTML5.

    The biggest companies in the open source space will again attend and
    participate, including Mozilla, SIOS, SparkFun, Red Hat, Engine Yard,
    GitHub, ForgeRock, HP, and Google.

    Jim Jagielski of the Open Source and Standards team will once again be
    presenting at POSSCON. His session will focus on boiling down the
    various complex varieties of community, governance, licensing and the
    like down to its basic components.
