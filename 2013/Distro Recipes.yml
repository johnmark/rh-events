    very recently by the time of this talk.

    This presentation will go through the interesting features that went
    into this release and will present the overall development process of
    this project, highlighting the aspects that are worth noting for the
    prominent community members like distributions.

    After the presentation, attendees will be kindly invited to share
    thoughts about ways to improvement community engagement or even just

    With the objective of maximizing the effectiveness of the contributors
    and keep the community organized, the Fedora Project is structured
    around several groups with clearly defined roles that will be presented
    here.

    In a second part, we present the applications provided to the
    contributors: from wiki system package building, through mailing lists,
    tracking tickets, the project manager, etc..

    Finally, we give an overview of the technical outlook for Fedora
    infrastructure projects underway and those planned for the short and
    medium term.

- title: 'Panel on Linux distributions: differences and commonalities'

    One of the main criticisms made to Linux distributions is the
    duplication of efforts. The purpose of this roundtable is to identify
    the reasons for the existence of these multiple distributions, and
    especially to show what are the means used by their communities to pool
    resources to reduce duplication of effort.

    Aspects of governance, manufacturing software, integration of
    components, packaging will be at the heart of this debate among
    stakeholders as well as the impacts and observations offered by a
    Microsoft representative.
