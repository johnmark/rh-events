    You’re a fantastic developer/coder of all trades/project
    manager/designer/sysadmin – but you want to be able to do a little more.
    Your focus up until this point has been fantastic at learning in your
    own discipline. Great!

    But what if you want to branch out? How do you get from point a to point
    b of adding additional useful skills? What’s your strategy for being
    able to choose your next level up? How do you set yourself up to
    practice the skills you want to learn?

    We’ll go through the strategic and tactical steps from choosing your
    next adventure, gathering your materials and acting on it from both a
    business perspective of a ‘career track’ as well as ways to be able to
    participate through open source.

    We’ll walk you through both a ‘traditional career track’ and an ‘open
    source way’ for the following:

    * Establishing your current baseline
    * Discovering your options
    * Thinking about what works for you
    * Perspective: short and long term goals
    * Perspective applied: short and long term gains
    * Unexpected adventures/opportunities
    * Re-evaluation levels – your own metrics of success

    Plus, it’ll be fun. Everyone will come away with something to work on,
    and audience participation will be encouraged.

    How do you grow the next generation of hackers? New little humans are
    clean slates. As parents, we get to fill them full of seditious thoughts
    about the value of sharing and taking control of your environment.

    As a parent of three kids, now 10, 7 and 5 years old, I’ve worked my way
    through the challenges of getting my kids enthusiastic about technology
    while avoiding the temptation of doing too much, too soon. This is one
    parent’s story of bringing his kids from pre-school construction toys
    through to building a solar powered Arduino-driven car built in part
    with components scavenged from old electronic toys.

    Come and hear lessons learned, get ideas for toys and approaches you
    might not be aware of, and please share what has worked for you!

- title: 'The Linux Way: Rebuilding The Unix Way for a New Era'

    The original UNIX philosophy could be summed up: “Write programs that do
    one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write
    programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.”

    Linux, as a “UNIX clone”, supports a command line environment that a
    1970s-era Unix hacker would find familiar — sed, awk, ps, and the rest
    are all there. But Linux has not stood still since catching up with
    proprietary UNIX. Using Linux for new jobs on new categories of
    computers has led us to extend the platform to suit our needs.

    * Is text still a “universal interface”, or is it now HTML? HTTP? Or
    JSON?
    * Should programs work together as filters, or via APIs?
    * Do we even need to care about portability any more?

    This talk will cover some of the ways the Linux platform has moved away
    from the Unix philosophy, while still holding true to some fundamental
    values, and how we users and hackers are defining a new Linux Way,
    distinct from the Unix Way.
