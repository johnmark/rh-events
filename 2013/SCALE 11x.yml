  Several employees have submitted talks to the 11th edition of the SoCal
  Linux Expo, but we're still waiting to hear back from the conference
  organizers. Our very own Ruth Suehle from the Fedora Marketing Team will
  be on hand in the Fedora booth, and she'll be joining the festivities
  for Friday's Meet and Greet for Fedora Contributors. More information
  will be forthcoming; in the meantime, stay tuned to the conference
