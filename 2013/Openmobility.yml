  Openmobility <http://www.openmobility.eu/en/>,
  Central Europe's leading conference for open mobile platforms and open
  source hardware, is taking place in Bratislava at the Faculty of
  Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Bratislava University
  of Technology
  <http://www.openmobility.eu/conference/om2013/venue/>.
  This year's conference will see some of the leading experts and
  developers in the Czech, Slovak and international Open Source community
  focusing on open mobile technology and open hardware. For the first
  time, Openmobility is going to take a closer look at the quickly growing
  DIY and Maker movement.

  Presentations will be held in English, Czech or Slovak.

  Several Red Hatters are going to give a talk in these areas, showing our
  leadership in all different open source communities, even outside the
  main track of the company.

talks:

- title: What are open & mobile platforms and Open Source Hardware? A brief introduction.

    What does the "open & mobile" and the "open source hardware" terms stand
    for and why it's important to have trully open & mobile and open source
    hardware platforms? This talk will give you a brief overview of past and
    current offerings in these areas and hopefully a hope for the near
    future.

    Imagine a machine or tool. Imagine you can send a CAD model to that
    machine from your computer or cellphone, wait a while and get a real
    object, that you can hold in your hands.

    Imagine this machine fits on your desk, imagine you can build it for
    about 400 €. Imagine it is fully open source, starting from firmware,
    trough control software to hardware. Imagine this machine can partially
    replicate itself.

    Sci-Fi? Nope. A real thing - RepRap 3D printer. Best with Fedora!

- title: GNURadio, HAM
  speaker: Jaroslav Škarvada

    GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that
    provides signal processing blocks to implement software defined radios
    (SDR). It can be used together with various external RF hardware or
    without hardware in a simulation-like environment. This talk will be
    short introduction to GNU Radio and available RF hardware including
    practical examples with USRP, Funcube dongle and RTL-2832 based TV
    dongle.

- title: 'Workshop: Qt/QML & Cascades'
  speaker: Daniel Vrátil
  start: 2013-04-06 15:00 CEST

    BlackBerry 10 is a new mobile platform which is primarily using Qt and
    QML and a custom set of QML components called Cascades. In this workshop
    we will shortly introduce Qt and QML and will cover basic concepts of
    Cascades. At the end we will create and deploy a simple Cascades
    application.

- title: ARM & Fedora
  speaker: Pavel Tišnovský
  start: 2013-04-07 14:30 CEST

    In this talk basic information about the ARM microprocessor and ARM
    architecture will be presented: history of ARM processors, introduction
    to various ARM instruction sets (including Thumb mode). The most
    important change in the ARM world - evolution from the "classic" 32bit
    ARM architecture to ARM64 - will be discussed too.

- title: 'Workshop: Writing standalone Qt & Python applications for Android'
  speaker: Martin Kolman
  start: 2013-04-07 15:30 CEST

    While Python and Qt (by the Necessitas project) are both already
    available for Android for some time, an easy method enabling development
    of combined Python & Qt applications that can be distributed as
    standalone APKs was not readily available until now.

    In the first part of the workshop I'll shortly introduce how Qt, Python,
    PySide (Qt bindings for Python), Python for Android together produce an
    Android APK that can be easily installed on most current Android
    devices.

    In the second part I'll introduce the powerful pydroid framework
    developed by Aaron Richiger, that enables very easy development,
    deployment, debugging and packaging of many types of Python & Qt
    applications (QWidget, QML, Qt Components) both using the Necessitas
    QtCreator IDE and just from the command line.
