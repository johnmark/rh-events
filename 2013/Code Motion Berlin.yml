    Big data and scalability is more than ever before the focus of webapps -
    on top of the always increasing need for fast response time for complex
    and rich website, such as Facebook, native mobile client have largely
    increased the existing load, the underlying complexity of such systems.

    With this in mind, many data grid products arise, in both the Open
    Source community and the proprietary world. The purpose of this talk is
    to illustrate, using a set of common use cases, how one can use a data
    grid such as InfiniSpan, either to enhance existing application -
    increasing their ability to cope with increasing load, or designed
    directly cloud-ready applications.
