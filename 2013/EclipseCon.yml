- title: Google Analytics for Eclipse Plugins

    It's always fun to see the download statistics for your plugin, but it
    is even more fun to see live who is actually using your plugin, how they
    installed it and where they are from.

    Getting that up and running can require a lot of bandwidth and
    infrastructure but luckily there already exist a well known analytics
    service called Google Analytics that can do this for you with all the
    graphs and earth-plots you want - even animated.

    We've implemented a plugin that utilizes Google Analytics to do all the
    heavy lifting of complex reporting and just leave it up to our plugins
    to setup and invoke a basic http request.

    We will present the inner workings on how this Google Analytics Usage
    plugins works, the legal challenges and report some of the interesting
    findings we have done over the years.

    For an example of what data and monitoring we have done see
    <https://community.jboss.org/en/tools/blog/2012/07/30/observations-from-two-year-of-ping-backs-from-jboss-tools-users>
    and <http://jboss.org/tools/usage> for

    Marketing is something we all do, whether we realise it or not.
    Marketing in Open Source starts when you're writing the software - who
    am I writing for? What will it do? Where will I announce it? I need a
    website! Marketing a project involves having a vision that attracts
    people to your project, knowing your target audience and how to reach
    them, and tailoring a product to meet their needs. Marketing an Open
    Source project also involves working transparently, providing
    opportunities for contribution, and setting a culture that makes people
    want to hang out and work to help realise your vision.

    I'll give you tools to help express your vision; to identify with your
    target audience and deliver something they will love; and to grow your
    project over time. There is no magic pill, and you'll have to use the
    tools to see results. But there is a way of thinking about marketing
    which is natural, and from which good things flow, from good website
    design, better return on time going to conferences, and a healthy,
    pleasant, growing community.

- title: A tale about a Big SVN to Git Migration

    In November 2012 I helped the giant JBoss Tools repo containing 400+
    eclipse plugins, 2+ millions line of code with 7+ year of history
    migrate from SVN into a multitude of Git repositories.

    Most existing large migrations I could find info about was about the
    size as one of our 30+ modules in JBoss tools and it turned out the
    advice in most of these just did not cope with a migration as large as
    this.

    During this tale I cover what tools I examined, rejected and in the end
    selected to do the migration. I will outline the migration process we
    did as a team, what things Git enabled immediately and which things we
    are moving towards now that Git have opened up for a more flexible build
    and development model and structure.

    Before this move a 6+ months long preparation and even longer thinking
    process was started to ensure all data would be migrated properly in an
    efficient and repeatable manner with as little possible impact on
    developer productivity as possible.

    After this talk you should be well prepared to do both small and large
    migrations to git for Eclipse based plugin projects and know what
    dangers to look out for and what tools to consider.

    If you want to take a sneakpeak you can see the scripts and instructions
    for the migration at
    <https://github.com/maxandersen/jbosstools-gitmigration>

    The tale almost ended up not having a happy ending because of a car
    crash, but due to the power of Git and Github the migration prevailed
    and I lived to tell the tale.

- title: OSGi Cloud Ecosystems

    OSGi and Cloud Computing go very well together. Previously held OSGi
    Cloud Workshops have shown that many people are using or planning to use
    OSGi in the Cloud. This session focuses how OSGi can really help in a
    Cloud environment, taking advantage of OSGi's dynamism and services
    model.

    The session will show how you can use OSGi to create a complex cloud
    deployment, which is made up from a number of different entities on
    different Cloud nodes. These entities are working together to form a
    logical application. This is what is being called an 'OSGi Cloud
    Ecosystem'.

    The session shows concepts such as dynamic provisioning, dynamic
    discovery, dynamic scaling and dynamic failover all from the OSGi
    programming model. I will also talk about cloud-related specification
    work that is currently an active topic in the OSGi Enterprise Expert
    Group.
