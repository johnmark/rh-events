    Open Innovation 2.0: Sustainable Economy & Society is a collaboration
    between the European Commission Open Innovation and Strategy Policy
    Group, Intel Labs Europe, Dublin City, Trinity College and many other
    stakeholders, organised in association with the Irish Presidency of the
    European Union 2013.

    A new paradigm, Open Innovation 2.0 (OI2) can help to achieve the Europe
    2020 vision. It is based on principles of integrated collaboration,
    shared value, new innovation ecosystems and rapid adoption. OI2 is the
    new paradigm for individuals and organisations to generate prosperity
    and harness the opportunities together. Enablers for this new paradigm
    are the exponential improvements in performance of ICT in parallel with
    globalization leading to significant increase in the rate and potential
    of interactions and possibilities for disruptive innovation.
