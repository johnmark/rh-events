  description: |
    Do you need to utilise many different public cloud technologies, or perhaps you’d like to put a cloud friendly shine on that rust old legacy VMware infrastructure. Perhaps the learning curve for OpenStack is too steep or it is missing critical feature you require? Take a look at ManageIQ, an Open Source project that can broker across on-premise IaaS as well as Public/Private cloud environments to provide a one stop shop for your DevOps needs.
    This session will cover the key features of ManageIQ and demo connectivity to a range of Cloud and IaaS technologies.

    Fed up fighting with the public cloud, or running out of space on your laptop next time you want to try our latest and greatest technology out?
    Thanks to technologies like nested virtualisation and thin-lvm you can now
    build, run and redeploy on your personal laptop a small data-centre's worth of technology. As great as the public cloud and shared lab environments are(n't), sometimes you just want to thrash out a problem quickly. What do you do when you're missing that extra storage or physical compute resource to make it happen?
    Come learn some tips and tricks.
    
- title: "Tutorial: Identity Management with FreeIPA"
  speaker: Fraser Tweedale

    FreeIPA is an integrated identity management solution providing
    centralised user, host and service management, authentication and
    authorisation in Linux/UNIX networked environments, with a focus on
    ease of deployment and management. It is built on top of well-known
    Open Source technologies and standards including 389 Directory
    Server, MIT Kerberos and Dogtag Certificate System.

    This hand-on workshop will provide participants with a comprehensive
    introduction to FreeIPA including server deployment and
    administration, client machine enrolment, and configuring server
    software to use FreeIPA's centralised identity and policy store.
    

- title: "Improving thread synchronization in GlusterD (Daemon for Gluster) using Userspace RCU (Read-copy-update)"
  speaker: Atin Mukherjee

    Gluster is a open source scalable distributed storage system which can run in any commodity hardware. GlusterD is the daemon which manages the cluster configuration for Gluster.

    GlusterD was originally designed as a single threaded application which could handle just one transaction at a time. It was made multi-threaded to improve responsiveness and support handling multiple transactions at a time. This was needed for newer features like volume snapshots which could leave GlusterD unresponsive for some periods of time.

    Making GlusterD multi-threaded required the creation of a thread synchronization mechanism, to protect the shared data-structures (mainly everything under the GlusterD configuration, glusterd_conf_t struct) from concurrent access from multiple threads. This was accomplished using the Big-lock.

- title: "Melvin: A new implementation of LVM in Rust"
  speaker: Andy Grover
  start: 2016-02-03 15:40 AEDT
  end: 2016-02-03 16:35 AEDT
  room:  Wool Museum
  track: 
  description: |
    The LVM2 logical volume management tool has been a mainstay of using Linux for many years. Rust is a new memory-safe systems programming language. Melvin is a pure Rust implementation of LVM2 and libdm functionality. This talk will cover why Rust is uniquely suited for rewriting LVM and other existing C-based projects: the benefits that accrue from a second implementation generally, and the benefits particular to using Rust. We will also peer under the covers of LVM to understand what's actually going on, what Melvin supports already, and what's still to come.


- title: "Speaking their language: How to write for technical and non-technical audiences"
  speaker: Rikki Endsley
  start: 2016-02-04 16:35 AEDT

  room: Costa Hall

    Open source communities are made up of individuals with a range of experience and expertise, so how do you write for the different audiences? Sure, you're comfortable shooting sentences over IRC or knocking out a note to your mailing list. But what about reporting your team's progress to a non-technical manager, or explaining your product to non-technical end users? Find out how to:
    * Define your audience(s)
    * Outline your idea
    * Decide what information to include and terms to define
    * Repurpose content for multiple audiences
    * Streamline the writing process

    Attendees will also see real examples of submissions for Opensource.com, which illustrate how marketing pieces, developer blog posts, announcements, event reports, and other formats can be turned into polished articles, tutorials, and documentation.

    Maybe you bought a Raspberry Pi a year or two ago and never got around to using it. Or you built something interesting, but now there's a new version of the Pi and new add-ons, and you want to know if they could make your project even better? The Raspberry Pi has grown from its original purpose as a teaching tool to become the tiny computer of choice for many makers, allowing those with varied Linux and hardware experience to have a fully functional computer the size of a credit card powering their ideas. Regardless of where you are in Pi experience, join Ruth Suehle and Tom Callaway to hear some of the best tricks for getting the most out of the Raspberry Pi. They'll also share some of the best projects they and others have built, from gaming devices to home automation, and they'll fill you in on what the Raspberry Pi 2 can help you do.
