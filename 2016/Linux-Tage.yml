  Since 1999 we organise the Chemnitzer Linux-Tage with a constantly increasing success. Naturally, as time goes by some members leave the team and new ones join however some of us are involved right from the start.

  We organise the Chemnitzer Linux-Tage because we want to give the people an understanding of Linux and Open Source and it is a lot of fun to organise a meanwhile so complex event. Furthermore we get motivated again and again anew by positive responses of visitors.

    Nowadays,virtualization is the foundation of many IT environments in medium and large enterprises. The KVM based Red Hat Enterprise virtualization and its upstream project oVirt, is a high performance and at the same time cost-saving open source solution combined with enterprise management features.

    This presentation will introduce virtualization solution oVirt. In addition to a short description of the particular components and tools, this talk will also cover typical applications scenarios. The second part of this talk will describe on how to contribute (with or without programming knowledge) to oVirt.
