  The Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC) is a developer conference for the open source community. The LPC brings together the top developers working on the “plumbing” of Linux—kernel subsystems, core libraries, windowing systems, etc.—and gives them three days to work together on core design problems.

  Additional details about the conference are available at
