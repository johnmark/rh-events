  OpenStack Days bring together hundreds of IT executives, cloud operators and technology providers to discuss cloud computing and learn about OpenStack. 
  The regional events are organized and hosted annually by local OpenStack user groups and companies in the ecosystem, and are often one or two-day events with keynotes, breakout sessions and even workshops. 
  Itâ€™s a great opportunity to hear directly from prominent OpenStack leaders, learn from user stories, network and get plugged into your local community.
