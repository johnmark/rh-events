    Networks Functions Virtualizationm or NFV, is a very hot industry topic
    at the moment. What you might not know is what it means -
    telecommunications companies who have traditionally used only
    proprietary software to run their core services are now embracing free
    and open source software, and in the process changing the way they
    build and deploy core telco serives to be more open.

    This presentation will review what makes up an NFV stack in OPNFV,
    covering OpenStack, OpenDaylight, Open vSwitch, DPDK, QEMU, the Linux
    kernel, and other projects. I will present the work being done in these
    communities to enable the migration of telco applications to this
    platform, particularly in the areas of improved network dataplane
    performance, enabling better management of applications running on the
    platform, and the ability to run real-time guest workloads with KVM.

    I will also look at the organisational transformation in the
    telecommunications industry, and the adoption of DevOps and agile
    practices, and the evolving culture of the telecommunications industry,
    and how the changes that are happening at the request of the
    telecommunications industry benefit everyone, from the home hardware
    hacker hobbyist to IT operations in small and large companies.

    The Difference between Theory and Practice is greater in practice then
    it is in theory. We are on the brink of our first official release of
    Shenandoah. It took two weeks to write up the design and over two years
    to implement it. This talk will discuss the differences between what we
    initially proposed and what we now have working. An honest look at
    compromises, wrong turns, and innovations. We will finish the talk with
    the theory of what comes next: A high level design for NUMA aware GC, a
    sketch of a plan for truly pauseless GC, a brief consideration of
    reference counting...

    Imagine you receive a report of a bug which causes a segfault (i.e. a
    memory exception) in the HotSpot Java VM very occasionally. This bug
    only occurs about one time in ten; it might take many hours before it
    happens. It has only been observed when running one particular piece of
    proprietary software. It only seems to occur on one large machine when
    running many concurrent threads and a huge heap. There is a clue: it
    only seems to happen when running the parallel scavenge garbage
    collector. But you've no real idea of how the garbage collector works.

    This happened to me in 2015. I'm used to being able to find and fix
    bugs, but this one resisted all of my attempts for a long time. As far
    as I can recall it's the most difficult bug I've ever fixed. In hunting
    this bug I used every tool available to me as a HotSpot developer. I'll
    describe them and how they were used.

    We don't much talk about debugging. Many of us spend much of our time
    doing it, but not talking or writing about this important activity. We
    should talk about it more. If there's time it would be good to swap war
    stories.

  description: |
    Thermostat has evolved a log way from being a specialised tool for
    performance monitoring and analysis of the JVM, first by encompassing a
    generic framework for performance analysis and data visualisation and
    now with the addition of a powerful and advanced new Platform
    infrastructure that also allow users to build completely standalone
    projects.

    The Platform offers a familiar environment that handles Model View and
    Controllers objects, presentation layer, threading models,
    visualisation and also special effects, and a new data architecture.

    In this presentation we will demonstrate how to build an application
    based on Thermostat in few simple steps and how to take advantage of
    the new architecture to build stunning and visually appealing
    applications.

    BMUnit is the package which integrates Byteman into JUnit and TestNG,
    enabling you to locally redefine the behaviour of application or JDK
    runtime code for the duration of a single test or group of related
    tests. BMUnit is very simple to use; just add a few annotations to your
    test classes and place a few jars in your classpath. This talk will
    explain how BMUnit works by presenting and executing tests which
    exemplify the 3 most common use cases:

    -

    injecting trace code so you can be sure your tests enter the expected
    code paths

    -

    injecting validation rules so you can assert that specific outcomes do
    occur

    -

    injecting 'faults' to modify state or control flow, driving the
    application or JDK runtime down the path needed to exercise a desired
    test scenario

    Thermostat Using Byteman')

    In this talk we will learn a bit about how USB devices can do evil
    things to your system and introduce a new tool, called USBGuard, that
    helps you to defend against USB-based attacks. The USBGuard software
    framework helps to protect your computer against rogue USB devices
    (a.k.a. BadUSB) by implementing a firewall-like system for whitelisting
    and blacklisting the devices based on their attributes. Finally, some
    of the advanced and planned features like USB traffic monitoring or
    network bound USB disk encryption will be presented.

    for CISCO's anyconnect VPN server, but it has now surpassed that role
    and provides a reliable VPN solution with a very conservative security
    architecture for the server. This talk will go through the story behind
    the development of the OpenConnect VPN server, address the question on
    the need for a new VPN solution and feature the distinctive security
    features and capabilities of openconnect. Finally we will provide an
    insight on the current development plans.

  track: Legal and Policy Issues
  description: |
    Legal decisions related to an open source project serve multiple
    purposes. One of the constituencies of these legal policies is the
    community of contributors to the project. Unfortunately, the effect of
    legal policy decisions by a primary copyright holder can have
    unanticipated negative effects on this constituency.

    Some legal decisions which have an effect on the contributor community
    are: \* License choice \* Contributor licensing agreements \*
    Determining origin of contributions and "clearing" them \* Trademark
    usage policy

    Dave Neary is a community manager with a long history of participating
    in and organising open source community projects, and he will walk you
    through some of the ways in which decisions in these areas have
    actively harmed project growth in the past, and may suggest some
    alternatives which accomplish similar goals without the same
    side-effects.

    Users (and developers) don't just want to run an executable, they also
    like to know that it runs efficiently, that it doesn't use unnecessary
    resources and if it crashes and burns they want to collect the pieces
    and inspect what went wrong. So a package should also provide the user
    with a means to easily profile, trace and debug what is running on
    their system. This means a distro should also package symbols,
    debuginfo and sources for easy/automatic installation. With different
    distros and different versions of distro packages running next to each
    other in containers we need some standard conventions to identify
    executables (build-id) and match and fetch the needed symbols,
    debuginfo and sources to help the user profile, trace and debug any
    binary they find on their system.

    Docker is not just for deployment. As a developer, there are many ways
    Docker can make you more productive, regardless of how your app gets
    deployed.

    In this session, you will learn practical strategies for using Docker,
    including how to:

    - Run unit tests locally in multiple environments with almost no
    overhead.
    - Make your integration tests easy for anyone to run by distributing
    them in a Docker image.
    - Simulate advanced network topologies, especially for a
    service-oriented architecture.
    - Make a Docker image in 5 minutes or less that produces builds from a
    consistent environment.
    - Isolate database state changes in your test suite by using a pool of
    disposable containers.

    become overloaded with incoming data. "Reactive" concepts can help
    overcome such challenges. In this presentation I'll show how oVirt
    embraced these concepts and evolved to Reactive architecture, and show
    the impact it had on overall system performance and stability.

    sys-admins and proprietary software, respectively, Linux Distributions
    are faced with a challenge. How do they get more relevant to the new
    power brokers?

    This talk will discuss the work taking place in the Fedora, CentOS, and
    Red Hat EL communities to address these challenges.

    Hypervisors get deployed in wildly different scenarios: datacenters are
    different from clouds, and both of these are different from the way we
    use virtualization on our workstations or laptops. This has resulted in
    the different projects using a layered approach, which makes everything
    modular, but prone to a lot of mismatches and errors. Effort has been
    ongoing on making these layers behave as a cohesive whole, while
    addressing the usecases and demands from the various deployment
    scenarios in a way that scales well. This talk will be focussed on the
    live migration aspect of virtualization, showcasing some of the
    usecases, and actual problems that have been solved while keeping all
    the usecases in mind.

    JRuby has for years routed around the JVM, to maximize compatibility
    with standard Ruby. We've implemented byte[]-based String and Regexp,
    native POSIX support, and our own mixed-mode interpreting/jitting
    runtime atop JVM bytecode.

    With JRuby 9000, we're taking this even further. JRuby 9000 introduces
    a new IR-based optimizing compiler, with inlining, specialization, and
    other tricks applied to both interpreted and bytecode-compiled code.
    We've also gone fully native for much of IO and Process management.
    This talk will show the state of this work and how it affects JRuby and
    the wider JVM world.

    OpenJDK is now a well established Free Software Ecosystem, with a
    vibrant Community and lots of interesting stuff going on, with
    projects, repositories, bug database and above all experiments!

    This is exciting and fun, but given the challenges of such massive
    project, it is intimidating and it is easy to get lost. It is also easy
    to forget that such massive infrastructure requires well defined rules,
    that are sometime perceived as blocking rather than aiding the
    participation. To help people wanting to contribute keep track of this
    intricate forest of development and find their way in, the Adoption
    Group was created (http://openjdk.java.net/groups/adoption/).

    This session is an exchange between few of the hackers directly
    involved with the Adoption Group and the public, we will answer
    questions the audience may have in relation to getting involved with
    OpenJDK, try to define and explain workarounds for most common problems
    (and blockers!) that newcomers face, discuss some of the projects we
    are currently involved with, and hope to be your Ariadne's thread to
    win back the fun of contributing and participating at all levels,
    without ever getting lost!

    Choosing a language, specially a relatively new language, for a project
    can be a challenge. Does it have enough documentation? Is it
    interpreted or compiled to machine language? How easily can it be
    built? How can it be tested? What libraries are available? These and
    other question like them are always asked by developers when
    confronting a new language for a project. In this talk we will be
    discussing the experiences learned while researching, designing,
    developing, and deploying project Heketi, a RESTful service used to
    intelligently allocate volumes in GlusterFS.

    we've started to apply our own dynamic language optimizations like
    inlining, specialization, and more. This talk will summarize the state
    of our work and how it's paying off for Ruby users.

    This is a talk about JRuby 9000s optimizing compiler and the work we're
    doing to optimize Ruby above the level of JVM bytecode. We'll also
    cover work to take better advantage of JVM optimizations and keep
    making JRuby the best Ruby implementation available.

    Once Upon a Time, Linux distributions were the "center of the universe"
    for free and open source software. If you wanted to reach users with
    your project, the best path to do so was to have your software packaged
    for the "major" Linux distributions of the time. Today, the world looks
    a lot different with language-specific package managers, microservices
    and containers, and so on. What's the role of Linux distributions in
    today's open source world, and where do we go from here?

    The demand for managing a large amount of data in a scalable yet
    reliable and cost-effective way has became more and more relevant in
    this day and age. Ceph, a software-defined storage, provides an
    original solution for this problem and guarantees a resilient and
    self-healing way for managing large amount of data up to the Exabyte
    level. In this session I will talk about a new feature introduced in
    oVirt 3.6 which provides the ability to integrate with Red Hat Ceph
    storage using Cinder, a storage service used mainly for OpenStack. This
    integration reveals new opportunities and tools for storage management
    in a scalable and virtualized way and also opens the door for
    interesting future integrations with other storage providers.

    We were asked to come up with a solution to setting up a cluster where
    storage, management and VMs are running together on small number of
    nodes. This solution is currently known as hyper converged
    architecture. This kind of setup seems to be getting quite common in
    small deployments, but it was not possible to use it and maintain all
    oVirt reliability features until now. This presentation will be about
    the system design and issues we encountered while installing the
    minimal possible reliable cluster using three hyper converged hosts
    with oVirt as the software stack and Gluster for the storage - all
    running together in highly available setup across all three nodes.

    A lot of folks are talking about containers vs. virtualization.
    Sometimes that makes sense, but there are also a number of cases where
    they're working together. I want to talk about the relationship between
    virtualization and containers, and some of the efforts to manage
    virtualization / IaaS technologies with containers to make them easier
    to deploy and manage. This includes efforts to containerize things like
    oVirt and OpenStack, as well as the best way to run KVM virtual
    machines in privileged containers.

    Learn how to get a Vagrant environment running as quickly as possible,
    so that you can start iterating on your project right away. I'll show
    you an upstream project called Oh-My-Vagrant that does the work and
    adds all the tweaks to glue different Vagrant provisioners together
    perfectly. I'll also demonstrate some tools such as vscreen and vcssh
    which make it possible to connect to single and multiple numbers of
    vagrant vm's more easily. We'll do all of this using the libvirt plugin
    to vagrant, which makes it possible to use the virsh and virt-manager
    tools in parallel with your vagrant toolset.
