  GUADEC is the main conference for GNOME users, developers, foundation
  leaders, individuals, governments and businesses worldwide. GUADEC is not
  just a software conference though! People come together to meet collaborators
  from chat rooms and mailing lists, to network, to visit old friends and make
  new ones, and to have fun.

  More information about the conference is available at
  <https://www.guadec.org/>.
