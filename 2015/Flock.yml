  Since 2005, Fedora users and developers have gathered at an event named 
  for them, the Fedora Users and Developers conference (FUDCon). Flock is a
  newer conference for Fedora contributors to come together, discuss new
  ideas, work to make those ideas a reality, and continue to promote the core
  values of the Fedora Community: Freedom, Friends, Features, and First.
