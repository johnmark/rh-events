  The SouthEast LinuxFest is a community event for anyone who wants to learn
  more about Linux and Open Source Software. It is part educational conference
  and part social gathering. Like Linux itself, it is shared with attendees of
  all skill levels to communicate tips and ideas, and to benefit all who use
  Linux and Open Source Software.  SELF is the place to learn, to make new
  friends, to network with new business partners, and most importantly, to have
  fun!

  Additional details about the conference are available at
