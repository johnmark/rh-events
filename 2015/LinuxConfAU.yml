  linux.conf.au is one of the foremost open source 
  conferences in the world, and is considered the 
  most prestigious in the Southern Hemisphere. Every 
  year open source geeks from across the globe gather 
  to meet their fellow technologists, share the latest 
  ideas and innovations, and spend a week collaborating 
  on free, open source software projects.

talks:

- title: "Miniconf: Clouds, Containers, and Orchestration"
  speaker: Joe Brockmeier
  start: 2015-01-12 10:40 NZDT
  end: 2015-01-12 17:20 NZDT
  description: |
    The Clouds, Containers, and Orchestration miniconf 
    will focus on the open source tools and best practices 
    for working with cloud tools, containers, and orchestration 
    software (e.g., Kubernetes, Apache Mesos, geard, and others). 
    We'll have the leading developers working on those tools, as 
    well as users who are deploying them in real production 
    environments to share their knowledge and show where tools 
    will be going in 2015.

    See the linuxconf.au [schedule](http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30150/view_talk?day=None)
    for details.

- title: "Miniconf: Open Source Documentation"
  speaker: Tim Hildred
  start: 2015-01-12 14:15 NZDT

    People often complain about the quality of open source 
    project documentation. At the same time, documentation 
    is a great place to get started contributing to an open 
    source community. This miniconf will explore practical 
    aspects of Open Source documentation, with an eye to 
    applying them right away.

    See the linuxconf.au [schedule](http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30255/view_talk?day=None)
    for details.

- title: Displayport MST
  speaker: David Airlie
  start: 2015-01-14 14:15 NZDT
  end: 2015-01-14 15:00 NZDT
  description: |
    Displayport is a VESA standard for transporting video/audio/other 
    data between devices, it is used on lots of laptop and monitors. 
    The Displayport 1.2 standard introduced a new technology called 
    multi-stream transport (MST), and a number of laptop dock 
    manufacturers (Lenovo, Dell) started using this technology to 
    provide the output ports on the dock; however nobody told the Linux 
    community this was coming (or nobody in the community noticed in 
    time). Armed with a dock and shiny Lenovo laptop provided by the 
    Red Hat IT department, David descended into the murky world of MST. 
    This talk is his tale.

- title: Deploying to the Cloud with Golden Images, Heat, and Docker
  speaker: Steve Baker
  start: 2015-01-15 11:35 NZDT
  end: 2015-01-15 12:20 NZDT
  description: |
    Image-based deployment of cloud applications is becoming a 
    reality thanks to the growing popularity of Docker; however 
    image-based deployments bring new challenges when it comes 
    to orchestrating and managing the life-cycle of complex 
    container-based applications. Heat is an orchestration service 
    that can be offered by an OpenStack cloud. Steve will demonstrate 
    how Heat is an ideal solution to orchestrate image-based 
    applications, whether they are packaged as Docker images or 
    full golden images. Image-building tools, such as diskimage-builder, 
    will also be presented, along with options for how to manage 
    images in the OpenStack or Docker registries. This presentation is 
    focused on Heat, but is aimed at anyone who deploys applications 
    to the cloud, regardless of whether they use Heat, OpenStack, or Docker.

- title: Programming Considered Harmful
  speaker: Dave Chinner
  start: 2015-01-15 16:35 NZDT
  end: 2015-01-15 17:30 NZDT
  description: |
    Dave will demonstrate that humans cannot Program. There is 
    evidence *everywhere* that we fail badly at Programming and 
    we repeatedly demonstrate that our attempts to Program don't 
    improve as complexity increases. Using examples from the Linux 
    Kernel, Dave will state his case for why he thinks we should be 
    engineering complex software rather than Programming, and how 
    that impacts on our code design and review processes.

- title: "Connecting Containers: Building a PaaS with Docker and Kubernetes"
  speaker: Katie Miller
  start: 2015-01-15 16:35 NZDT
  end: 2015-01-15 17:30 NZDT
  description: |
    Learn how Red Hat is using Docker and Google's Kubernetes project to
    redefine modern application platform services. New container-centric
    tools for managing resources in the cloud have helped to establish
    new best practices, prompting a redesign of Red Hat's open source
    OpenShift Platform as a Service. This talk will give an overview of
    Docker, Kubernetes and the container-focused Atomic OS, and explain
    how these open source building blocks have been used to create the
    next generation OpenShift V3 PaaS.

- title: "FreeIPA: Open Source Identity Management"
  speaker: Fraser Tweedale
  start: 2015-01-16 14:15 NZDT
  end: 2015-01-16 15:00 NZDT
  description: |
    Fraser's talk will cover the basics of FreeIPA, 
    the main features it provides (and why those features matter), 
    the deployment process, how to enroll clients in the domain, 
    and interoperability with Active Directory and other technologies.
    He will conclude with a look ahead to what's on the roadmap.
