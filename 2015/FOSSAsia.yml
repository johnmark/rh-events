    Attend a free 2015 oVirt Asia workshop at FOSSASIA in Singapore with 
    star technologist Brian Proffitt. This 3 hour workshop is designed to
    teach us about oVirt, learn what we can do with oVirt virtualization,
    encourage collaboration in our community, lay the foundation for best
    practices in oVirt use, and help answer questions about the project from
    both a developer and user's perspective.
