    Containers enable organizations to deliver business outcomes faster. The demands of modern application development and IT operations cannot be addressed using old methodologies.

    Linux containers, and Docker as a container packaging format, are radically transforming IT and drawing interest in their benefits to how applications are built, shipped, deployed, and managed.

    Red Hat has transformed application delivery with the first fully open source, hybrid cloud platform for container-based applications and services. At this technology event, we will address how modern technology and methods can solve top enterprise concerns for container adoption
