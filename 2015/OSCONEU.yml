  Since 1999, the O'Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCON)
  has been unique gathering of all things open source. You'll
  encounter the open source ecosystem in its entirety—the full
  open source stack—exactly as you approach it in your work.
  You'll learn about the latest developments, add to your skills,
  and discover how other people are solving the same problems
  you're working on.

  At OSCON, participants find inspiration, confront new challenges,
  share their expertise, renew bonds to community, make significant
  connections, and find ways to give back to the open source movement.
