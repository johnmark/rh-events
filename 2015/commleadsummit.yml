  The Community Leadership Summit 2015 brings together community leaders,
  organizers and managers and the projects and organizations that are
  interested in growing and empowering a strong community.

  The event pulls together the leading minds in community management,
  relations and online collaboration to discuss, debate and continue to refine
  the art of building an effective and capable community.

  At the heart of Community Leadership Summit 2015 is an open unconference
  style event in which everyone who attends is welcome to lead and contribute
  sessions on any topic that is relevant. These sessions are very much
  discussion sessions: the participants can interact directly, offer thoughts
  and experience, and share ideas and questions. These unconference sessions
  are also augmented with a series of presentations from leaders in the field,
  panel debates and networking opportunities.
