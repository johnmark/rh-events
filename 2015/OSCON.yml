  OSCON is where all of the pieces come together: developers, 
  innovators, businesspeople, and investors. In the early days, 
  this trailblazing O'Reilly event was focused on changing 
  mainstream business thinking and practices; today OSCON is 
  about how the close partnership between business and the 
  open source community is building the future. That future 
  is everywhere you look.
