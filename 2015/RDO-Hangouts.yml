      On February 9th, at 14:00 UTC, Eoghan Glynn will
      present a hangout covering what's coming for Ceilometer in the Kilo
      release of OpenStack.

      It will be [streamed live on 
      YouTube](https://plus.google.com/events/cht3k5nr5u73pv3d08i7vq5m570), 
      and will also be available at that location afterwards.

      Kilo milestone 2 is due on February 5, so this is traditionally around
      the time that mid-cycle meetings happen to evaluate the status of
      projects, and set expectations for what will actually make it into the
      release. So I hope that we'll be able to schedule more of these
      hangouts in time between Milestone 2 and the release on April 30th.
      (See the [Kilo release schedule](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Kilo_Release_Schedule) for details.)
