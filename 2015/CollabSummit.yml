  The Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit is an invitation-only developer focussed event,
  which aims to encourage and facilitate collaboration between different open source projects.

  Additional details about the conference are available
  [on the conference website](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit).

talks:

- title:  'Panel: The Future of Open Networking and Cloud Infrastructure'
  speaker: Stefano Maffulli, OpenStack; Chris Price, Ericsson; Chris Wright, Red Hat; Phil Robb, The Linux Foundation; Neela Jacques, OpenDaylight Project (Moderator)
  start: 2015-02-18 11:30 PDT

    A panel bringing together representatives of OpenStack, OPNFV, and OpenDaylight, including
    Stefano Maffulli of OpenStack, Chris Price of Ericsson, and Chris Wright of Red Hat, to
    discuss how the future of networking and cloud infrastructure is open, and how these
    projects work together.

- title: The GNU C Library Update!
  speaker: Roland McGrath, Google & Carlos O'Donell, Red Hat
  start: 2015-02-19 09:00 PDT

    The GNU C Library (GLIBC) is a part of almost all Linux systems deployed today. The library
    continues to be a key piece of the low-level interface between user applications and the
    Linux kernel, and as such an important enabler for new hardware, kernel features, and new
    system-wide APIs.

    This talk will cover the work by the community to add support for new features including
    Intel MPX support, lock elision for s390 and s390x, optimizations for ARMv7 and ARMv8, and
    file description locking support for the same Linux kernel feature.

    This talk is but a small slice of the problems being tackled by the community. The goal is
    to walk away with a broad view of the ongoing work and direction of the library.

- title: Cutting Through The Container Hype

    Virtualization was the next Big Thing. Then cloud. Now, containers are at the peak of
    hype, led by the excitement surrounding Docker and containers. Project Atomic hopes
    to temper innovation with better management and control, and it's not alone: CoreOS,
    Docker's suite of enterprise products, and most recently, Ubuntu's Ubuntu Core all
    hope to capture this market. But what is the market? Is container technology the best
    plan for DevOps and an increasingly cloud-oriented IT?

- title: The Secrets to Open Source Innovation

    Open Source is a phenomenon made possible by the will of the customer and end user,
    leading to a world where end users collaborate directly with developers. This was
    not by accident: end users were able to collaborate in this way because of the
    establishment of the four freedoms and the resulting managed ecosystem of open
    source platforms. The resulting changes in development process led to open source
    becoming the dominant way to innovate in software. Ultimately, open source is a
    victory of process, governance and agility, which are at least as important as the
    code. But what lessons can we take away from open source domination, especially as
    we advance forward with new technologies? If the four freedoms drove open source
    development, will they play the same role in the advancement of cloud computing?

    In this talk, we will look at examples from the cloud computing world and other
    areas of science. Is the secret to innovation the creation of sound processes
    and good governance?

- title: Using ftrace (and Other Tools) for Performance Analysis
  speaker: Steven Rostedt, Red Hat

    Ever wonder why a tool you used suddenly dropped in performance when upgrading to a
    new kernel? This can be very difficult to find the exact cause of such a problem.
    But luckily there are several tools to use to help one out. The first tool to try is
    perf. perf is well documented as a performance analysis tool. But sometimes that
    doesn't give you enough information to find the cause of the degradation. Ftrace can
    give you a different view of the system. This talk will show how to use ftrace and
    other little known tools of the kernel to find out why a new kernel version has
    suddenly introduced performance issues to the tools running on top of it.

- title: The Linux perf probe & trace tools
  speaker: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo, Red Hat

    The Linux perf tools continuously grows in scope as an observability toolchest, with
    more features being added. This talk showcases the 'probe' and 'trace' tools: one
    allows adding dynamic probes in arbitrary points in the kernel and in userspace libs
    and programs, collecting global and local variables and callchains, that can then be
    used in conjunction with other perf tools: record, top, trace, script. The later,
    trace, started as a super strace, one that allows stracing not just threads, but
    other targets such as the whole system, sets of CPUs. It also has a lower overhead
    as it doesn't use the ptrace syscall. Support for tracing page faults and other
    events and collecting callchains is planned and may be ready by Collab'15. An
    example of integration using 'probe', capturing syscall arguments for pretty
    printing, showcasing 'candidate tracepoints' will also be presented.

- title: Perf Tool Scripts
  speaker: Jiri Olsa, Red Hat
  start: 2015-02-20 14:30 PDT

    This presentation will help developers better understand perf scripting features
    and help them to use existing scripts or write their own.
