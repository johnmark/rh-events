    Gartner predicted it: containers are the new hot stuff of the moment.
    However, the technology itself is not sufficient, and this talk will
    present a example architecture that can be deployed for hosting the web
    infrastructure on Docker, Atomic, Kubernetes and Ansible, showing how
    the different pieces inter-operate, the decisions you will need to
    make, and how your deployment and workflow will be affected.

    Ah, food. What would we do without it? Probably starve. And that's no
    fun. No fun at all! Starving is bad. So let's not do that. Let's have
    lunch instead. Lunch will be provided. You are also free to bring your
    own or go out for lunch. But if you stay, you'll have the fantastic
    opportunity to nosh with your fellow attendees and learn more about
    open source, mission critical software, best practices, and maybe even
    have a laugh or two.

    At DevOps Days Rome 2012, in November, Ulf Mansson proclaimed his
    new-found love for monitoring and we changed the hashtag into
    #monitoringlove. Based on a new era of open source tools, Ulf started
    loving monitoring again. And for a lot of us he was absolutely right.
    Over the past 5 years an enormous amount of new tools and new patterns
    has come out of the community sometimes tagged with #devops, pretty
    much all of them open source. Do you still know what you should be
    using for what? And what the differences are? An opinionated overview
    of the open source monitoring landscape to clear up the confusion on
    what you should use, or make the decision even more difficult on you.

    What is "Cloud Management"? In a datacenter, you might have 2 or more
    virtualization management platforms, with a private cloud running
    alongside, and some workloads running in a public cloud. ManageIQ gives
    admins and developers a way to seamlessly deliver services from
    multiple cloud and virtualization platforms. Across your cloud and
    virtualization platforms, you'll need to enforce some kind of
    consistency in who can consume your resources, integrate with approval
    workflows, and be aware of waste when it is happening. Maybe you also
    want to automate the provisioning of instances, integrate with a
    service catalog or configuration management system. Perhaps you want to
    know when VMs are vulnerable to security issues, prevent new VMs to be
    created from known-bad templates, and perform some clean-up of services
    when they are retired. These are all cloud management problems. Whether
    it's curing VM sprawl or finding and fixing hot spots in the data
    center, this presentation will give you tools and techniques you can
    use to manage it all.

- title: 'A Story of Two Best Buddies: OpenStack and Docker'

    On one side you have the kid that used to be that everybody was talking
    about, and on the other side the new fancy kid that everybody is
    talking about. OpenStack is an Infrastructure as a service OpenSource
    project that have seen a really large support and adoption from users
    and large companies. Docker is a easy API and tools to make Linux
    containers super easy to manage and change the way you are looking at
    your deployment to be more focus on the application. For a bit of time
    the two was contemplating how their workflow could fits with questions
    like "is a container a VM or can a VM considered a container?". Things
    now are well defined and most OpenStack components have been updated to
    support Docker. In this session we are going what are the use cases
    between Docker and OpenStack, how they can live happily in your
    infrastructure, and what are the ways to make it even better in the
    future.
