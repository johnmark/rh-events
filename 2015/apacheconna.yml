  ApacheCon brings together the open source community to 
  learn about and collaborate on the technologies and 
  projects driving the future of open source, big data 
  and cloud computing. Apache projects have and continue 
  to be hugely influential in the innovation and development 
  of software development across a plethora of categories 
  from content, databases and servers, to big data, cloud, 
  mobile and virtual machine. The developers, programmers, 
  committers and users driving this innovation and utilizing 
  these tools will meet in Austin, April 13-17, for 
  collaboration, education and community building.
