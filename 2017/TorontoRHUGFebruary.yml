  OpenShift Workshop Day
  (Don't forget to bring you own computer!)
  Hello Toronto Red Hat Users. One of the topics that has been identified to be of great interest for our group is the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (Containers, Docker, and Kubernetes).
  To that end, I have arranged for out user group to participate in a OpenShift Workshop. This is an all day education session with the goal to educate you as much as possible about OpenShift. In this session will be a combination of instruction and hands-on labs on real live OpenShift environment.
