    The current state of litigation between Oracle and Google provides a
    fascinating perspective on fair use in the context of U.S. software
    copyright law. During this session, the audience will be put in the jury box
    to obtain an important and unique perspective on why the trial returned a
    unanimous verdict in favor of Google, essentially concluding that the
    copyright fair use doctrine allowed Google to use JAVA SE APIs in its
    implementation of Android. Extensive synthesis of jury instructions, CAFC,
    and district court documents were used in the preparation of this talk. A
    brief background on the case will also be provided.
