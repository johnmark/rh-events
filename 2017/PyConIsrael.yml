  Following the success of last year's event, we'll have a bigger and better event this year!

  This time we're cooperating with Django Girls Israel, who will have a workshop hosted at Red Hat Israel offices (https://djangogirls.org/raanana/).

  The main event is cooperating with PyData, and will have a designated track.

  Additional details about the conference are available at
