  PostgresOpen 2017 delivers two days packed with tutorials and presentations about PostgreSQL and related technologies, one day of extended trainings, and the usual hallway and social track!

  PostgresOpen Silicon Valley is a non–profit, community–run conference series in the United States focused on business users, database professionals and developers of PostgreSQL, the open source database. This year PostgresOpen has combined forces with PGConf Silicon Valley to bring together two large Postgres conferences to create an even larger and exciting event.

  Additional details about the conference are available at
