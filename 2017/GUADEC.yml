    Flatpak is an application distribution and runtime system that brings
    sandboxed linux desktop apps to the masses.

    This talk will give a status update of the flatpak project and what has
    happened in this year. It will also talk about new and interesting
    things happening in the echosystem around flatpak and where we're going
    in the future.

    Linux distributions have been traditionally put together from
    individual packages. In case of Fedora it's RPM packages. They have
    served us well, but they also have a number of shortcomings: with small
    individual components the testing matrix explodes when we have to
    consider different package versions, and upgrading such systems is
    often irreversable.

    In this talk I will lay out a plan how we are going to put together an
    atomic base system in Fedora Workstation with flatpaks for individual
    applications. I will demo the latest progress we've made and show a
    great many screenshots.

    This year, GNOME turns 20. Over the course of its history, the project
    has pioneered new ways of working and has set out a powerful mission
    for itself: from championing usability and accessibility, to
    establishing the six month release cycle, GNOME has been at the
    forefront of Free Software development. However, there are also risks
    for a project that has been running this long: collective knowledge can
    be forgotten, and it is easy to lose touch with the beliefs that give a
    project purpose.

    In this talk, I'll ask the question: what is it that defines the GNOME
    project? In attempting to provide my own answer, I'll describe the
    principles that I think make GNOME so important. I'll also recount
    stories from GNOME's history, and in so doing make a case for what
    constitutes the project's folklore. Finally, I'll ask the question: how
    do we ensure that, as GNOME looks to the future, the project continues
    to nurture these traditions?

- title: Recipes - lessons learned from creating a new app

    Cooking and recipes is not a new topic for the GNOME community.
    All the way back to 2007, the idea of a GNOME cook book was already
    around (https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeCookbook). For one reason or
    another, we never quite got there - but the idea has stuck around, and
    after Guadec last year, the two of us got together to finally make
    GNOME recipes a reality.

    Our talk will cover the original design goals and the evolution of the
    design from paper mock-ups and ideas, to refining a raw prototype and
    to the complete application that we have to today. We will touch on the
    interaction between design and development and how you can be
    successful in this even when you have to bridge a 7 hour time
    differential.

    We will take a look ahead at whats coming in 3.26, and how the original
    design goals are evolving and expanding as we build out the
    application.

    On the technical side, we will explore some of the challenges and
    lessons learned during the development of recipes, and we will explain
    how writing this application was useful for developing and refining new
    technologies such as sandboxes, portals and new build systems. There
    may be an aside about portability.

    Of course, there will be a demo of recipes.

- title: The inbetweens — why transitions matter.
  speaker: Jakub Steiner
  start: 2017-07-30 10:00 CET
  end: 2017-07-30 10:30 CET
  room: Hopper - G44
  description: |
    After spending considerable amount of time prototyping designs for
    GNOME, over and over again I've met with resistance to transitions as
    being a "waste of CPU/GPU time" and not enjoying a wide acceptance
    among developers.

    I'll present my case as to why transitions are helpful conveying
    meaning and spatial awareness.

- title: Flatpak and KDE, and the state of qt integration in GNOME
  speaker: Jan Grulich, Martin Bříza
  start: 2017-07-30 14:00 CET
  end: 2017-07-30 14:45 CET
  room: Hopper - G44

    Flatpak is a tool providing new and easy way how to distribute desktop
    applications. While it is pretty well supported in Gnome, we in KDE
    have been trying to catch up and offer same experience. In this talk,
    Jan Grulich will share with you what KDE has been lately up to and what
    has been accomplished during last year.

     Martin Bříza will also cover how we advanced with how well are Qt
    applications integrated into the overall GNOME experience.

     Topics covered will include the state of the Adwaita and Highcontrast
    themes, new QGnomePlatform (abstract platform theme backend for GNOME)
    features and Wayland support.
