  The CentOS Dojos are a one day event, organised around the world, 
  that bring together people from the CentOS Communities to talk about 
  systems administration, best practices in Linux-centric activities, 
  and emerging technologies. The emphasis is to find local speakers 
  and tutors to come together and talk about things that they care 
  about most, and to share stories from their experiences working 
  with CentOS in various scenarios. Seating is limited so [register 
  early](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/centos-dojo-bangalore-india-15th-nov-2014-tickets-12252039179).
