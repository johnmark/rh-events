  Hard to believe another quarter has gone by in the world of Ceph development! 
  So much has happened with the release of Firefly (late, but well worth 
  the wait!), another smashing OpenStack Developer Summit, and of course 
  the acquisition of Inktank. As the dust settles from all of the hustle and bustle 
  we’re looking to get back on track with development.

  So, since it has been a while since our last summit we thought it would be a 
  good idea to have another “interim” summit to discuss work in flight, anything 
  new that may have come up, and look forward to both our “Giant” and “Hammer” releases. 

  Blueprint submissions begin June 2nd, and end June 16th. The schedule will be posted
  after all blueprints are received, and start on June 24 and carry over to June 25
  if needed.
