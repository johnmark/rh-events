      Foreman is a lifecycle management tool for hosts, helping from
      provisioning through to configuration management and monitoring. It's
      traditionally been associated with Puppet, but now boasts Chef support
      with fact and report handler integration.

      In this session, we'll see how Foreman fits into your infrastructure and
      the provisioning and Chef integration in action.

      Followed by an "office hours" session with the speaker at 15:15 PDT.
