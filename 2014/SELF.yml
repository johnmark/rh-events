  The SouthEast LinuxFest (SELF) is a community event for anyone who wants to 
  learn more about Linux and Free & Open Source software. It is part 
  educational conference, and part social gathering. Like Linux itself, 
  it is shared with attendees of all skill levels to communicate tips, 
  ideas, and to benefit all who use Linux/Free and Open Source Software. 
  LinuxFest is the place to learn, to make new friends, to network with 
  new business partners, and most importantly, to have fun!
