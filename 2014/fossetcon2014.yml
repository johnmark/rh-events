    Fossetcon is not a GNU/Linux conference, nor is it a *BSD conference. 
    Fossetcon can be more described as a *nix(Unix like) conference that focuses
    primarily on Free and Open Source Software and the systems that run it -
    whether it be hardware or software. We are calling all FOSS, FLOSS, and OSS
    Developers, Students, Teachers, Systems Administrators, Hardware Hackers,
    Enthusiasts, Newbies and Trolls(trolls need love too) to come out and
    participate in Fossetcon 2014 in Orlando, FL.

    If you need to run multiple versions of Python, Ruby, MySQL or something other
    than the default system tools, you may not have many options. Developers and
    system administrators need more flexibility. This presentation will show how
    Software Collections can be used to accomplish this task.
