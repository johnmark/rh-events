    The Open World Forum is the first European summit to gather 
    political representatives, decision-makers and experts, in 
    one place, in order to debate the technological, economic and 
    social impacts that the Free and Open-Source technologies 
    bring to market. The forum was first held in 2008, and is now 
    organized annually in Paris, France, with more than 200 speakers 
    coming from 40 countries, and a global audience that was 
    2200-people strong in 2013.
