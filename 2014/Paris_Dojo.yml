  The CentOS Dojo's are a one day event, organised around the world,
  that bring together people from the CentOS Communities to talk about
  systems administration, best practises in linux centric activities and
  emerging technologies of note. The emphasis is to find local speakers
  and tutors to come together and talk about things that they care about
  most, and to share stories from their experiences working with CentOS
  in various scenarios. See the event page on the CentOS Wiki:
