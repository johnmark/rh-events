    Modern high-scale storage systems embody a bewildering 
    variety of interfaces, features, and performance profiles. 
    Starting with an overview of key factors that should drive 
    purchase and design decisions, we'll compare block stores, 
    object stores, file systems, and even databases. Evolutionary 
    trends and emerging technologies will also be highlighted, 
    ranging from new physical media to erasure coding.

    Learn how Red Hat IT utilizes and integrates open source 
    solutions to offer a seamless experience for internal users. 
    Specifically, we will cover how Red Hat incorporates SAML, 
    Kerberos, LDAP, Two-Factor Authentication, PKI certificates, and 
    how end-user systems are able to function in this multi-platform, 
    fluid BYOD environment. Find out how Red Hat is scaling this 
    identity management platform to utilize true single sign-on in 
    cloud environments, and learn best practices and about

    Learn about challenges associated with ensuring your 
    infrastructure is secure in the cloud. Cloud providers 
    are careful about letting customers run penetration 
    tests because they can be mistaken for real attacks, 
    but such tests help confirm that data is safe. Find out 
    about the conditions and limits of permissions obtainable, 
    and methods of doing targeted tests that will not affect 
    others using multi-tenant hardware. 
    
- title: Simplified Remote Management of Linux Servers 
  speaker: Russell Doty

    OpenLMI (the Linux Management Infrastructure program) 
    delivers remote management of production servers, ranging 
    from high end enterprise servers with complex network and 
    storage configurations to virtual guests. Designed to 
    support bare metal servers and to directly manipulate storage, 
    network and system hardware, OpenLMI is equally capable of 
    managing and monitoring virtual machine guests. Learn how a 
    sys admin can use the new tools to function more effectively, 
    and to extend and improve existing management workflows and 
    expertise.
    
- title: "Making Containers Useful with Project Atomic" 
  speaker: Brian Proffitt
  start: 2014-11-14 11:45 PST

    Virtualization was the next Big Thing. Then cloud. Now, containers 
    are at the peak of hype, led by the excitement surrounding Docker. 
    But is this hype justified, or can innovation be tempered and 
    improved by better management and control? This is the problem 
    Project Atomic hopes to solve.
