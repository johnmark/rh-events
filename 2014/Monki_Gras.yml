  How can one discipline inform and improve another? How is practitioner
  knowledge shared in real life, past the traditional rubbish about
  “best practices”. How does a community create a shared culture
  and values in order to be effective and sustainable?

  Massive top down efforts to define models and languages continue
  to fail – with the collapse of Waterfall methodology, the ongoing
  irrelevance of theoretical lingua franca such as UML.

  But social coding is changing everything, and the new world is based
  on better sharing of mores and methods. Code is Craft, and can be
  shared accordingly.

  This exclusive event will feature some of the best and brightest
  people in the industry, as both attendees and speakers. We aim for an
  inclusive, community feel, where everyone has a voice and something
  to add to the conversation. But for great speakers look no further.
