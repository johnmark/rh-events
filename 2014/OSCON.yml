    Everything open source (and we mean everything).
    From the early days of open source, OSCON has been the only 
    event that covers the open source stack in its entirety. 
    Not just one language, tool, or philosophy, but all of the 
    moving parts, integrated and working together. It's everything 
    you need to know about open source to keep you ahead of the curve.
