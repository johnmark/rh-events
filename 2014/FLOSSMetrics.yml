    Situational awareness is vital in any situation. If you are unaware
    of an issue, then you are in a poor position to fix it. However,
    there is a natural human response to the publication of metrics,
    which is to optimise for what is measured. Here are some cautionary
    tales of how performance metrics inadvertently created incentives
    for behaviour that was bad for the system.

- title: Incorporating Community Metrics and The Open Source Way
  speaker: Karsten Wade
  start: 2014-07-20 14:35 PDT

    practices of using open source methodologies in projects and other
