    on-demand cluster provisioning and on-demand Hadoop task execution
    (Elastic Data Processing).
    In this talk, we will provide an overview of project Savanna, its
    main goals and focus, and a tour of new features introduced in the
    Icehouse cycle. These features include: integration with Heat, basic
    API tests in Tempest, enabled asynchronous gate, and bunch of new
    Elastic Data Processing (EDP) features. We’ll also discuss new
    Hortonworks Data Platform plugin features, data-locality support,
    and the ability to use Savanna through the command line. Finally, we
    will discuss the roadmap for the Juno release.
    After attending this session, you will have a good understanding for
    where Savanna is now and where it’s going, particularly with regard
    to the Unified Agent approach, on which we’re currently working on
    leveraging in Savanna.

- title: "Divide and Conquer: Resource Segregation in the OpenStack Cloud"
  speaker: Stephen Gordon
  start: 2014-05-12 14:50 EDT
  end: 2014-05-12 15:30 EDT
  description: |
    As a cloud deployment grows both in size and in variety of workloads
    it is useful to be able to segregate compute resources based on
    factors such as physical location, networking connections, or the
    availability of specialized hardware. OpenStack provides a number of
    options for segregating compute resources in the cloud including:
    - Cells,
    - Host Aggregates,
    - Regions, and
    - Availability Zones.
    The differences between each of these approaches are nuanced and
    often misunderstood. Additionally the capabilities available when
    using some of these techniques, particularly Host Aggregates and
    Cells, have been expanded in recent OpenStack releases.
    This session will provide an indepth look into these each of these
    options for segregating resources in the OpenStack cloud including
    their pros and cons, example use cases, and performance
    considerations.

- title: Customizing Horizon without breaking on upgrades
  speaker: Matthias Runge
  start: 2014-05-12 16:40 EDT
  end: 2014-05-12 15:20 EDT
  description: |
    In probably most cases, when Horizon, the OpenStack Dashboard is
    installed, it's desired to change it's look and feel to meet the
    corporate look and feel.
    In many installations, software is deployed via software packages.
    When updating or upgrading software via distribution packages, in
    almost all cases changes applied to files installed will become
    overwritten. In this session, we'll show, how to achieve both,
    changes and not to break due package updates or even upgrades.

    During Icecouse development cycle, a the plugin architecture
    blueprint was implemented; this session will show, how to create or
    modify a look and feel along distribution provided packages that
    will not break on minor package updates or version upgrades.

    In large deployments, some piece of Nova is deployed almost
    everywhere.
    Until recently, the story for how you upgrade to using a newer
    version of this fast-paced project has been turn off the cloud" --
    an unacceptable answer for something that aims to be deployed at a
    scale large enough to make such a plan unfeasible. Over the last
    several releases, "upgrade-ability" has been a major theme of
    development for the Nova team, shooting for both reduced downtime of
    core components and elimination of the need to "turn off the cloud"
    while thousands of nodes are upgraded atomically.
    This talk will cover the incremental steps we have made in
    recent cycles, as well as reveal the major new capability that
    the Icehouse release brings to the table.

  speaker: Steve Baker
  start: 2014-05-13 15:40 EDT
  end: 2014-05-13 16:20 EDT
  description: |
    Until the Icehouse release of Heat, configuring software on
    orchestrated compute resources has required a cumbersome combination
    of declarative configuration, shell scripts and wait conditions.
    Heat now has a flexible mechanism to configure software throughout
    the life-cycle of compute resources. It is also now possible to
    integrate with software configuration tools such as Puppet or Chef,
    allowing configuration to be represented in a number of different
    ways.
    In this session you will learn a number of different approaches to
    configuring software using Heat such as cloud-init, shell scripts,
    Puppet and golden images. You will also learn how to add support for
    other configuration management tools.

  speaker: Keith Basil
  start: 2014-05-14 11:00 EDT
  end: 2014-05-14 11:40 EDT
  description: |
    Operational awareness and value for cloud operators has largely been
    ignored by the OpenStack community. Today with the maturity of
    TripleO and inclusion of Tuskar, we can now begin to think about
    TripleO's use as a vehicle for OpenStack infrastructure management.

    The question now is How do we extend TripleO with additional
    value?".

    Within this context, there are several areas of integration which
    can be explored. These include an operator dashboard, infrastructure
    instrumentation agents, bare metal drivers and other supporting
    services. Hardware and software vendors can gain insight into what
    integration looks like from a product point of view.

    In this session, we will explore:
    - Why TripleO works for infrastructure management
    - TripleO management integration points
    - What TripleO means for hardware/software vendors
    - Early work in this area

- title: Breaking the Mold with OpenStack Swift and GlusterFS
  speaker: Luis Pabon and John Dickinson
  start: 2014-05-14 14:40 EDT
  end: 2014-05-14 15:20 EDT
  description: |
    Red Hat uses OpenStack Swift as the object storage interface to
    GlusterFS. Instead of reimplementing the Swift API, Red Hat is
    participating in the OpenStack Swift community to ensure that
    GlusterFS can take full advantage of the latest Swift features. This
    is absolutely the right way to pair Swift with another storage
    system - use the existing functionality in Swift and contribute back
    to community where additional functionality is needed. This talk
    from their respective project leads will show how Swift and
    GlusterFS work together to take advantage of the best each system
    has to offer.

- title: "OpenStack: Where Continuous Delivery and Distros Collide"
  speaker: Mark McLoughlin and Monty Taylor
  start: 2014-05-14 16:30 EDT
  end: 2014-05-14 17:10 EDT
  description: |
    Like many open-source projects, OpenStack uses a time-based release
    model. Feature development happens in a flurry of activity in the
    first part of each release cycle and then we taper, allowing enough
    time for many eyes to make shallow bugs" and for us to gain enough
    confidence in the quality of our release candidates. Even after a
    release, we continue to maintain a stable branch for issues found
    and fixed post-release.

    Linux distros apply a similar model when they bring together the
    releases of many open-source projects into a coherent, usable and
    stable product. OpenStack's predictable release schedule, the
    tapering, the stabilization and the post-release maintenance are all
    essential to the needs of distros and, in turn, the users of those
    distros.

    Unusually, OpenStack also explicitly caters to another type of users -
    what we call "trunk chasers". Public cloud providers like HP and
    Rackspace invest significantly in a continuous delivery pipeline
    so that they can keep pace with OpenStack development, deploy
    regularly, give timely feedback upstream and minimize the risk
    associated with each incremental update. In these days of agile
    development, DevOps and continuous delivery, the benefits of such
    a model are now clear.

    As such, OpenStack is an important case study for how recent
    thinking around continuous delivery is influencing open-source
    projects. Many questions remain unanswered, however. Are we going
    to continue to see projects like OpenStack see themselves as
    catering to two radically different audiences, or is this the
    beginning of fundamental shift in open-source?

    Mark and Monty - Openstack Technical Committee and Foundation
    Board members, prominent OpenStack contributors and senior
    engineering leaders at Red Hat and HP - have had the opportunity
    to look at this dilemma from several different angles. In the
    talk, they will delve into some of the details behind how
    OpenStack caters to both models. They will examine the mindset and
    needs of each audience. They will talk about topics such as CI,
    upgrades, deployment tools, reference architectures, community
    management, feature development, user feedback and more.

    Attendees can hope to learn some more about OpenStack and some of
    the challenges in running an open-source project, building a
    distro or maintaining a public cloud. Beyond OpenStack, however,
    the talk should provide some more general food for thought around
    the agile development methodologies used by many application
    developers today versus the methodologies used by open-source
    projects today.

    How has the OpenStack User Experience (UX) group contributed to the OpenStack Community over the past year? In this session, you'll get to hear how the UX group is helping to shape features and improve the overall user experience in OpenStack and verifying that designs are meeting target end users needs. We will give highlights of our progress in the following areas

    - Understanding the OpenStack users
    - Requirements gathering
    - Interaction design
    - Design support during development
    - Usability testing and feeding results back into new requirements

    We will also discuss the recent efforts, which builds on Dave Neary's previous work, to develop a set of personas to help the development community align with their users' needs and tasks.  We'll review the methodology used to develop the personas, insights from the user interviews, and the personas created from the effort.  Finally, we will provide recommendations and examples for how the community can effectively use the personas during their own planning, design, development, and testing efforts to improve the overall user experience.

    The Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) is a new, non-profit public cloud
    being created in Massachusetts. It will be the product of
    collaboration between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, five large
    research universities (MIT, Harvard, BU, NE, and UMass), and an
    array of private sector partners. It will be located at the 15MW
    Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) in
    Holyoke.
    The MOC will stand apart from existing single-provider clouds by
    enabling multiple entities to provide (rather than just consume)
    computing resources and services on a level playing field. Big and
    small companies, and even researchers, can expose their hardware or
    software services through the MOC, make them available to a large
    community of users, and derive revenue from doing so.
    We will discuss the vision and status of the project, the central
    role OpenStack plays in its implementation, and some of the required
    changes needed in OpenStack to enable a multi-provider open cloud.
