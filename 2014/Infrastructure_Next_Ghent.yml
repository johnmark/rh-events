  Infrastructure.Next is the event for people interested in the evolving
  tools and projects for managing large-scale IT infrastructure. From
  storage to configuration management to virtualization infrastructure,
  all the way to Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). This is a one-day
  program that will help practitioners learn more about efficiently
  embracing the software-defined datacenter.
