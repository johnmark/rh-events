  Texas Linux Fest is the first state-wide, annual, community-run conference 
  for Linux and open source software users and enthusiasts from around the  
  Lone Star State. Much like SCALE in Los Angeles, Ohio Linux Fest in Columbus, 
  and Linux Fest Northwest &ndash; and an ever-growing list of successful regional 
  shows &ndash; Texas Linux Fest is a weekend event geared towards individual users, 
  rather than an expensive multi-workday expo that might cater primarily to 
  sponsored attendees. Whether you use free software and Linux at home, in your 
  place of business, in your school or non-profit, or you are simply curious, Texas 
  Linux Fest offers something for you.
