  Started in 2013, the Defense in Depth workshops bring members of Red Hat's
  Security Engineering communities to Washington, D.C. for a day of technical
  sessions and hands-on labs. Attendees learn about the latest developments
  (both GA, and upstream), the latest projects within the DoD and Intelligence
  communities, and Red Hat Engineering gets to hear directly from customers
  on their needs. In 2014, sessions span SCAP, SELinux, Docker, Cross Domain
  Supercomputing, and generally reflect sharing of current projects effecting
  government customers.
