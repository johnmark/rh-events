    This talk will focus on the complex but important relationships that
    exist between various standards and related open source projects, the
    Linux kernel being a good example. It will show how both sides can
    contribute efficiently toward a common goal of interoperability and
    large deployments. It will also expose some of the common problems that
    can bring such cooperation to a halt.
