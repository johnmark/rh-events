    This panel will provide people with four different perspectives on
    getting started in open source projects. Panelists represent a range of
    industry and academic backgrounds, a diversity of contribution types,
    and a variety of projects of all sizes, ages, and types. We’ll relate
    our own “what we wish we’d known” beginner stories in the hopes of
    inspiring others to start on the road to becoming open source
    contributors.
