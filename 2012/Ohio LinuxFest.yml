- title: 'Aeolus: Deploying Across Clouds the Open Source Way'
  speaker: Mo Morsi
  start: 2012-09-29 15:00 EDT

  description: |
    Aeolus is a next-generation cloud computing API allowing system
    administrators to deploy, monitor, and manipulate instances running on
    any number of cloud providers in a consistent manner. Using the free and
    open toolset end users are able to access and manage cloud resources
    without having to worry about vendor lockin and/or changes in cloud
    provider terms of service and pricing. In this session we will
    demonstrate how to use the Aeolus utilities to deploy instances to
    various cloud providers, monitor running services, and take and migrate
    snapshots of Linux systems across disparate providers.

    This talk will describe what he considers the "holy grail of
    availability" - running highly available applications inside of highly
    available virtual machines. This is what most customers have asked for,
    and now we have the technology to accomplish this goal. It will outline
    the requirements, best practices, and experiences of trying to
    accomplish this once daunting task. Technology will concentrate on
    ovirt.org/KVM and Pacemaker - but will also touch on Red Hat Cluster
    Suite, RHEV/KVM, and VMWare.
