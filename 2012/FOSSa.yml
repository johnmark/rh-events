    Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, Software as a
    Service... in the world of the cloud, the user has less and less
    visibility into what is happening under the covers of his computing
    environment.

    What does it mean to be Free Software if you are not distributing any
    software? What is the nature of communities for cloud projects like
    OpenStack? And in a cloudy world, can people still hope to control their
    computing environments? Will the cloud kill Free Software?
