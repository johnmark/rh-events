    For the fifth year running, the Community Summit addresses the key
    issues impacting the growth and management of open source communities.
    This year, free and open source software communities leaders at the
    Summit will look at the challenges posed by the emergence of cloud
    computing to their communities and will ponder on new vendor lock-in
    strategies, the repositioning of software, the necessary linkage with
    open data, etc.
