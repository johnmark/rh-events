  description: |
    Whether you like it or loath it, Java the language and Java the platform
    have set the standard for enterprise computing for over a decade and
    don't look like giving up that top spot for a while yet. However, we
    continue to hear complaints about the complexity of developing
    applications with Java and it is no secret that J2EE wasn't always the
    easiest beast to conquer. Various frameworks sprang up over the years to
    try to simplify the lives of Java enterprise developers, such as Seam
    and Spring, and with the advent of Java Enterprise Edition 6 (EE6) and
    changes in the JVM to allow non-Java languages to be supported, we are
    starting to see a renaissance. In this presentation we will look at some
    of the things that have happened in the last few years that have already
    increased the productivity of enterprise Java development, including key
    features like CDI in EE6 and changes in the Java Community Process.
    We'll illustrate some of this with the new release of the JBoss
    Application Server, AS7, which is a full EE6 compliant application
    server yet is fast, modular and lightweight. We'll also look at some
    other advancement that are happening in open source that will also help
    and which may make their way into the standards.
