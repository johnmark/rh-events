- title: 'Virtual Machine snapshots: Overview and Illustration of Different Types
    of Snapshots with libvirt/QEMU'
  speaker: Kashyap Chamarthy
  start: 2012-11-05 11:05 CET

    This session discusses different types of virtual machine snapshots with
    QCOW2 disk images. A snapshot is a view of a virtual machine (its OS and
    all its applications) at a given point in time, giving an ability to
    revert to a known sane state in case of a failure. The session also
    includes a brief demonstration of the different types of snapshots under
    discussion (Internal snapshots, External snapshots, System Checkpoint,
    Online/Offline snapshots) and their use-cases. Audience would include
    Linux system administrators familiar with KVM virtualization. The
    take-away would be an overall understanding of different snapshotting
    capabilities using QCOW2 disk images, and some practical examples which
    could be applied while managing virtual machines and snapshots. Finally,
    a glimpse of upcoming developments in this area.

- title: Assembling a Kernel Test Grid with Autotest

    Autotest (autotest.github.com) is a framework for fully automated kernel
    testing, although it works fine for userspace bits as well. In this
    presentation, we'll discuss the strategies and techniques you can use to
    deploy a fully automated test farm, with periodic or per-commit test
    jobs, with bare metal machine provisioning, console control and VM
    testing. For embedded farms we need a different approach, which will be
    discussed as well. The presentation consists in slides and a demo using
    virtual machines on the presenter's laptop.

- title: FreeIPA Tutorial
  speaker: Jakub Hrozek
  start: 2012-11-05 13:20 CET

    The tutorial will provide a hands-on introduction to FreeIPA - an
    integrated identity management solution. The FreeIPA project brings
    together several industry-proven technologies such as LDAP or Kerberos.
    Easy-to-use installation scripts and both command line and browser-based
    interfaces make previously complex task of rolling out enterprise
    identity management easy, scalable and accessible.

    We'll demonstrate the installation, setup and several tasks such as user
    management or establishing a trust setup with an Active Directory
    domain. We'll also show the advantages of using the SSSD for client
    machines, like the ability to access identity servers offline.

    The tutorial is mainly targeted at system administrators. Rudimentary
    knowledge of technologies such as LDAP is advantageous, but not
    required. A VM image based on Fedora 18 will be available for the
    attendance to experiment easily.

- title: 'SSD Devices & Caching: fscache, Block Cache or Device Driver'
  speaker: Ric Wheeler
  start: 2012-11-05 14:15 CET
  end: 2012-11-05 15:00 CET

    SSD devices promise a lot - very high random IO rates, high performance
    streaming IO and different failure modes than traditional storage. SSD
    devices are still considerably more expensive than traditional storage,
    so multiple projects have worked to use SSD's as a cache for cheaper and
    denser traditional storage.

    This panel will have developers from several SSD caching projects - file
    system, device mapper and device driver level caching. For more

    Two years ago we announced the systemd project and began integrating it
    into the distributions. Since then it acquired a lively and large
    community, has been adopted by a variety of commercial and community
    distributions, and has gained wide acceptance in the desktop, server and
    embedded world. Today, you can buy devices and appliances built on
    systemd, and systemd is the basis of industry standards. It is time to
    look back on the first two years of systemd, analyze what we achieved,
    where our successes are and where our weaknesses. It's time to discuss
    where we want to take the project next and what to focus on.

    This talk is intended for all technical folks, administrators and
    developers alike, as well as everybody else who is interested in the
    systemd project, its strengths and the next steps.

- title: 'Coding for Fun: Silly Projects Keep You Sane!'

    When I was a kid, the computer was my favorite toy. I would spend hours
    of time coding just for the fun of it. This love of computers led to a
    career in software development, which has been greatly rewarding! But,
    once anything becomes a job it is difficult to stay in love with it even
    when your job is open source.

    So, find a hobby? Do something else! That's great, but for me nothing
    has the same mental reward as a good computer project. It just sucks to
    constantly be at the mercy of other people's demands... My solution has
    been simple: retro-computing! I don't just use the computers of my
    youth, I make them do interesting new things! It's crazy, of
    course...but I love it! Maybe hearing about my experiences could be
    useful for you to find your way to avoid burnout? You may not want to
    dig-out an 8-bit micro for your next project, but maybe a robot, or an
    arduino, or...

    The oVirt Project is an open virtualization project providing a
    feature-rich server and desktop virtualization management platform with
    advanced capabilities for hosts and guests, including high availability,
    live migration, storage management, system scheduler, and more.

    oVirt provides an integration point for several open source
    virtualization technologies, including kvm, libvirt, spice and oVirt
    node. oVirt was launched in November 2011 as a fully open source
    project, based on assets from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager
    platform. The project has an open governance model, and initial board
    has members from IBM, Canonical, Cisco, Netapp, Red Hat and SUSE.
