    This talk will cover the topic of managing packages across several
    environments and staging. We'll cover topics including the package
    resources included in Puppet core, how to hack on the Yum and Deb
    providers, and how to extend Puppet via custom resources and basic
    principals of idempotent operations. Some knowledge of the package
    management and Puppet resources is ideal for users attending the talk.
    We'll build on that knowledge and move into more advanced topics like
    custom providers and resources.
