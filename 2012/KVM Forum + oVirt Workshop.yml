    Enlightenments are enhancements made to the operating system to help
    reduce the cost of certain operating system functions. Presently, all
    recent Microsoft OSes support Hyper-V enlightened I/O and hypervisor
    aware kernels. Number of Hyper-V Enlightenments, like virtual APIC,
    spinlocks and invariant TSC can be implemented in KVM.

    This presentation should be interesting to a wide audience, but mostly
    targeted to developers.

    Anthony Liguori has contributed the QEMU Object Model (QOM) as new
    infrastructure for device modeling and inspection at the beginning of
    this year. Highlight some of the changes for device authors this
    requires and provide an outlook of what new possibilities this offers
    over former qdev. Focus of this talk will be my ongoing CPU remodeling -
    vision, achievements for v1.1 and v1.2, next goals.

    I assume that Anthony will say some words about QOM in his key note.
    This presentation will not cover the why/how but rather the how-to and
    where-to for device authors in the status quo as well as some DOs and
    DON'Ts concerning CPU\*State for all contributors. Depending on upstream
    progress this talk might also cover a brief overview of differences
    between softmmu and linux-user wrt CPU. I don't plan to go into x86 CPU
    hotplug details, that could well be covered by Igor/Eduardo in a
    separate talk.

  description: |
    In this session we cover two aspects of live migration:

    * We discuss the work of moving the execution of outgoing live migration
    to a separate dedicated thread in QEMU.
    * Using a separate thread for live migration reduces contention with the
    IO thread and vcpus which results in higher throughput and more reliable
    downtime.

    We analyze Live Migration performance state:

    * Performance on very large guests and the issues we encounter with such
    a guest. This discussion will include convergence and actual downtime
    (compared to user configured downtime).
    * Live migration effects on the running guest (downtime and performance
    impact on the guest workload)
    * Resource consumption (network bandwidth and CPU usage)

    Qemu is currently based upon a Pentium Pro chipset, which was first
    released in 1996. It still continues to serve us quite well, but there
    are a number of limitations, especially in the PCI space. I am currently
    updating a patchset first brought forward by Isaku Ymahata to add a new
    machine model based on Intel's Q35 chipset. I will discuss the new
    features that Q35 introduces, including the topology, the chipset
    devices, and the pci express features (aer, ari, hotplug, power
    management). I will provide an update on its status - testing,
    performance, and any remaining merge hurdles.

    The intended audience is qemu/kvm developers. I'd like to get them
    interested in the new chipset, and and to suggest potential new
    development areas that Q35 opens.

    Libguestfs is a C library that provides a way to access and modify
    virtual machine disk images. It uses qemu and the Linux kernel, so we
    can manipulate just about any disk image, filesystem, partitioning
    scheme, LVM, Windows disks, and more. Above this layer are many
    specialized "virt-\*" tools for carrying out specific tasks. In this
    talk, Richard Jones will give a live demonstration of libguestfs and the
    virt tools, and talk about the new features available in libguestfs
    1.20.

- title: Building Application Sandboxes on Top of KVM or LXC Using libvirt
  speaker: Daniel Berrange
  start: 2012-11-07 17:00 CET
  end: 2012-11-07 17:30 CET
  description: |
    Historically most usage of virtualization has focused on running entire
    operating systems in virtual machines or containers. The libvirt-sandbox
    toolkit builds on libvirt, KVM & LXC, to provide a high level API and
    command line tools to facilitate the use of virtualization as a
    technology for creating secure application sandboxes, without the burden
    of maintaining additional OS installations. The talk will cover the
    architecture of the sandbox technology, the challenges faced in its
    design & implementation, use cases it can address and the scope for
    future development.

    The talk is suitable for a broad audience, covering system
    administrators, application developers & virtualization platform
    developers. A basic understanding of virtualization and security
    concepts is assumed. The audience will learn what capabilities the API &
    tools provide & how they can be applied to their environment.

- title: KVM autotest - It's not Just a QA Tool Anymore
  speaker: Lucas Meneghel Rodrigues
  start: 2012-11-07 17:00 CET
  end: 2012-11-07 17:30 CET
  description: |
    KVM autotest is a large set of functional and performance tests for KVM
    (both kernel and userspace). The design goals of the project were to
    provide infrastructure to perform extensive and systematic tests, and
    it's largely considered a QA only affair.

    However, during the last couple of years, we've been working on bringing
    the benefits of this flexible test framework for developers, a
    fundamentally different use case. This required re-thinking the
    structure of the project.

    This presentation aims to show the work that has been done in making the
    tests more approachable and useable for KVM developers:

    * Separation of tests from autotest core
    * Exposing APIs for convenient use on external test scripts
    * Abstract concepts that are not entirely necessary for a casual
    developer to make use of autotest (such as configuration files)

    We'll talk about what was done and what's on the pipeline, with a demo.

    This talk will present a high level description of current work on
    virtio, vhost - in general with focus on paravirtualized networking in
    particular.

    The talk will start with a quick overview of a paravirtualized
    networking in KVM. It will next describe new enhancements in this field
    developed in the last year, most of them performance-related.

    The talk will include a description of upcoming challenges in enhancing
    paravirtualized networking in KVM.

    For a selected subset of the enhancements the talk will include some
    background and motivation, an architecture-level view of the
    implementation and a short description of the benefits to the user.

    The talk is targeted at developers with high level understanding of KVM
    and networking, and interest in their internals.

  description: |
    oVirt web administration application (WebAdmin) is a powerful tool to
    manage various assets of the virtualization infrastructure. In addition
    to existing functionality, there can be times when administrators want
    to expose additional features of their infrastructure through WebAdmin
    user interface.

    In this session, Vojtech will present the concept and implementation of
    UI plugins, upcoming oVirt feature that allows third-party developers to
    extend WebAdmin user interface and related functionality. UI plugins
    integrate with WebAdmin directly on the client through JavaScript
    programming language, which makes the plugin infrastructure simple and
    flexible.

    Attend this session to learn more about UI plugins, update on current
    implementation, and live demo showing how to write and deploy custom
    plugin. This session is intended for anyone interested in extending
    oVirt WebAdmin functionality.

  speaker: Avi Kivity
  start: 2012-11-08 11:15 CET
  end: 2012-11-08 12:00 CET
  description: |
    QEMU's original memory API, was complicated, hard to use, incorrect,
    insecure, did not scale, and consumed a lot of memory. None of these was
    particularly problematic with the original use cases of emulating
    embedded boards, or perhaps running a virtualized desktop system to use
    "the other OS". However, for enterprise and cloud users running hundreds
    of untrusted guests on a single host, the API and its implementation
    presents a problem.

    This talk will cover the new QEMU memory API, its design considerations,
    and how it addresses the limitations of the old implementation.

    Vala/C application. It will present the libgovirt library, a GObject
    library wrapping oVirt REST API, and then expand on the work that needed
    to be done in Boxes. Finally, we will talk about the future improvements
    that can be done for this support.

    The audience should have basic development experience as it will
    describe my experience with wrapping the oVirt REST API in C, and then
    using it in a Vala application.

    The block layer is one of qemu's most complex subsystems, and it has
    seen a very high and even increasing development activity recently. This
    talk will give an overview of the features of the block layer and its
    basic objects, highlighting the changes since last year and outlining
    some plans for the future.

    It will span the whole area from guest devices (IDE, AHCI,
    virtio-blk/scsi) to block drivers implementing different image formats
    and protocols (especially qcow2) and background jobs operating on block
    devices, referring to the more detailed talks that may be given on some

    SLA@oVirt is quite challenging. Allowing users to have policies to
    prioritize virtual machines, limit CPU and RAM consumption, and allow
    overcommitment are not easy tasks. Now throw in VM affinity, VM
    High-Availability and see what we're up against.

    In this talk, oVirt users, developers and others will get a review of
    existing SLA and scheduling elements in today's oVirt, as well as new
    features added and being added into current and future versions of
    oVirt. Relevant architecture and API changes across oVirt project will
    be discussed, and feedback is more than welcome.

- title: The Road to Effective Thin Provisioning in QEMU
  speaker: Paolo Bonzini
  start: 2012-11-08 13:45 CET
  end: 2012-11-08 14:30 CET
  description: |
    QEMU (and hence KVM) has long supported thin provisioning, through both
    sparse raw files and image formats such as qcow2. However, there are
    several limitations in the implementation of this feature, which make it
    much less effective as the lifetime of a virtual machine image grows.
    This talk will cover how thin provisioning can help both virtual machine
    and host administrators, as well as when/how it can be used now. It will
    also present a plan for making this feature more generally, effectively

    The VFIO userspace driver interface is now available in Linux v3.6
    release candidates and the matching Qemu driver will be merged into the
    Qemu 1.3 release. By the time of this talk, VFIO will be available in
    the latest stable kernels and the Qemu development tree. VFIO breaks
    physical device assignment free from KVM, making it available to more
    architectures, more platforms and more device types. In this talk we'll
    take a high level look at VFIO and IOMMU grouping with a focus on how to
    make use of it, the restrictions and benefits it adds, and how it
    compares to KVM PCI device assignment in setup, functionality, and
    performance.

    This talk gives an overview of GlusterFS for scale-out storage
    management of KVM disk images. GlusterFS creates network attached
    storage on commodity hardware, including features for elastically
    adding/removing nodes and georeplication. Recent improvements in
    GlusterFS and KVM make it easy to run VM disk images on GlusterFS
    volumes. We also focus on GlusterFS architecture and how it could be
    extended for virtualization-specific needs.

    Previous experience with KVM or GlusterFS is not necessary, but a
    general understanding of virtualization and disk images is required.
    Users of NFS and iSCSI may be particularly interested in this talk to
    see how GlusterFS approaches networked storage differently and is
    uniquely flexible.

    Over the last year, QEMU's support for live block operations has grown
    to encompass atomic snapshots of multiple disks, merging of snapshots
    via block streaming and block commit, and block mirroring support.

    While this talk is suitable for technical end-users, it deals with
    features that are primarily accessible by means of QAPI and QMP
    commands. It will focus on the snapshot and merging commands, how these
    operations are performed, and their limitations. Block mirroring will
    also be covered in similar detail. In addition, this talk will feature a
    demonstration of live atomic snapshots of multiple devices, and
    subsequent live merging of the resulting images by means of block commit
    and block streaming.

    Multiqueue networking of kvm guest were introduced to eliminate the
    bottleneck of current single queue model and scale the performance for
    smp guest running on hosts with multiqueue cards. Multiqueue capable kvm
    guest will have a higher network performance compared to single queue.
    This presentation discusses the design and implementation of extending
    the kernel/qemu components of both host and guest to be multiqueue
    capable. Performance numbers and pending issues will also coverd in the
    talk.

    The developers, customers and hardware vendors who are interested in the
    solution of high performance virtualized networking were targerted at
    this talk. They would expect a kind of high performance solution with
    multiqueue and virtio-net. Some basic knowledge of kvm, virtio and high
    performance networking were required for this talk.

    An overview of the various infrastructure tools and services available
    in the ovirt.org domain. We’ll discuss various aspects from how
    different tools are leveraged with a heavy focus on the use of Jenkins
    for build and test automation, Gerrit for source code management, and
    Puppet for configuring the various servers for different uses. We’ll
    also discuss how we grew the infrastructure from a just a couple of EC2
    hosts to where we are today, to where we’re planning to go in the
    future.

    This is primarily geared toward people interested in how we go about
    managing and coordinating the various pieces of infrastructure in the
    oVirt site. It will range from high level discussion of what we're
    trying to accomplish to diving into some of the technical details. I'd
    like this talk to be very interactive, but will be prepared to present
    in the event there aren't a lot of questions.

    Having recently passes its second birthday, OpenStack is a relatively
    new entrant into the world of open-source virtualization. Since its
    announcement, it has gained incredible traction and momentum with
    hundreds of developers contributing to each release. OpenStack's success
    * and the potential for it to be deployed pervasively at massive scale,
    particularly in public clouds - presents an opportunity for KVM's
    continued growth and adoption.

    Mark, a former KVM developer, will introduce the OpenStack project, its
    architecture and current status. Mark will then talk in some detail
    about how OpenStack currently uses KVM and libvirt before setting the
    scene for a a discussion about how OpenStack could adopt more of KVM's
    unique features to the benefit of both projects.

    Boxes is a new GNOME application for easily handling other systems:
    local virtual machines and remote desktop. A local machine is powered by
    KVM and SPICE, and you can access remote desktop via libvirt, SPICE and
    VNC. During this talk I will demonstrate latest version and describe the
    design of Boxes. I will discuss the importance of Boxes as part of the
    GNOME project. Finally, a list of missing features and the roadmap for
    the next cycle will be presented.

    The talk is indented for Linux users, system administrators and
    developers a like. Audience will be expected to have very basic
    understanding of, and experience with virtual machines, Linux and GNOME.
    Experience with virtual machine managers, like virt-manager will be an
    advantage but not required.

    The VM scheduler is the heart of a private cloud, it selects host for
    your virtual machine, decides about VM migrations and aligns the load on
    the hosts. While this is not a simple task, performance and the costs of
    the virtualization system is largely dependent on the decisions this
    component makes. JBoss Drools can help us to make the decision logic
    more readable and easier to extend by specifying rules rather than
    trying to rewrite an existing algorithm. This approach promises better
    performance for your private could through better decisions.
