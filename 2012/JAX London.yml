    A deep dive on creating mobile-ready, cloud-enabled, HTML5 applications
    based on Java EE and modern JavaScript. You will learn how to balance
    and combine the enterprise Java programming model, based on APIs such as
    CDI, JAX-RS and EJB 3.1, with JavaScript libraries like jQuery Mobile,
    Backbone, Require and Underscore, while taking advantage of the ease of
    deployment and elasticity of the cloud.
