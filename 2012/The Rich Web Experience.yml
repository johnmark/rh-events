    Open Source is about building a community of developers and users around
    a project willing to cooperate, exchange ideas and provide peer review.
    Participating in the project provides mutual benefit to all parties,
    including better software, skill improvement, respect, and being a
    member of a group of peers. But how does it happen? What motivates
    people to join your project? How do you grow the community?

    We'll use Seam 3 as a case study. We'll present the factors we believe
    led to a 3000% increase in the project team in just one year, with many
    contributors leading one or more modules of the project. By the end of
    this talk, you should have plenty of ideas about how to increase
    participation so your project can realize these benefits.

    Writing documentation is already hard enough. Why do we make it more
    difficult by burying the content in an XML syntax like DocBook or
    wrestling with finicky WSYWIG editors? Come learn how to write
    documentation with pleasure using AsciiDoc and still be able to produce
    beautiful HTML, DocBook and PDF documentsand even presentation slides!

    Writing documentation is already hard enough. Why do we make it more
    difficult by burying the content in an XML syntax like DocBook or
    wrestling with finicky WSYWIG editors?

    What if you could just write? Forget about the layout and styling and
    just let the thoughts flow? That's the idea behind the lightweight
    markup languages such as AsciiDoc. With AsciiDoc, the bulk of document
    is the content, embellished with subtle and intuitive semantic
    notations. AsciiDoc is designed for humans, yet machine parsable. It can
    even meet the most advanced publishing requirements.

    Come learn how to write documentation with pleasure using AsciiDoc and
    still be able to produce beautiful HTML, DocBook and PDF documentsand
    even presentation slides! Like this one.

- title: Bake your HTML5 website with Awestruct, publish with git

    Static is the new dynamic. Learn how to use Awestruct to build and
    publish static websites and leverage the ever increasing capabilities of
    HTML5-based browsers to make your site more dynamic than ever before.

    Static is the new dynamic. With the ever increasing capabilities of
    HTML5-based browsers, we can give the server a rest and put security
    problems behind us by publishing static HTML5 documents and shifting the
    dynamic behavior to the client. Not only does that let you blog out of
    static hosting sites like github pages, it also means you can put more
    processing power into the author tools.

    In this session, you'll be introduced to Awestruct, a Ruby-based tool
    for building and publishing static websites. You'll discover how you can
    leverage a wide range of lightweight markup languages such as HAML,
    Textile, Markdown, SASS and CoffeeScript to keep your source terse and
    DRY. We'll use Awestruct's extension pipeline to setup a blog, add
    comments to your site or add analytic tracking scripts to your pages,
    then build and publish the site to github pages in a single command.
    Just because the pages are static doesn't mean they can't be dynamic
    too.
