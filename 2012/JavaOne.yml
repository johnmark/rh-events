    The myth of Java EE as a cumbersome platform is easily dispelled in this
    session, which aims to create a working application, from a blank
    repository to a live cloud deployment, in real time. It \* Covers tools
    that bootstrap project creation, freeing you from mucking around with
    Maven POM boilerplate \* Generates a domain model and reverse-engineers
    JPA entities from it \* Automatically creates the scaffolding for tests
    that run in a real Java EE container, launched from the IDE \* Pushes it
    all to production on a public site

    Using a variety of projects from the JBoss Community adhering to and
    building upon open standards, this presentation can create real
    enterprise apps in the time it takes other sessions to click through
    some slides. Let’s get building!

    Key concepts of reliable distributed computing developed during the ’80s
    and ’90s, such as transactions and replication, have influenced Java EE.
    However, the way enterprises are using networked computing for
    businesses is undergoing rapid changes as new ways of constructing
    distributed execution environments from various resources—ranging from
    computational, storage, and network to application-level services
    provided by globally distributed service providers—are emerging. In
    light of these developments, this session examines what core concepts,
    components, and techniques will be required in the Java middleware of
    the future.

    OpenJDK has enjoyed growing popularity over the last four years. A large
    amount of focus has gone into developing OpenJDK itself, but relatively
    little effort has gone into enhancing the surrounding ecosystem. This
    session first covers the open source efforts to increase OpenJDK
    adoption over the past four years. It also includes an open discussion
    to engage the community to increase involvement and further improve upon
    what has been done so far. Topics covered include the efforts that have
    gone into and the benefits of IcedTea, IcedTea-Web, and Thermostat (a
    new project). If attendees are working on an open source project with
    similar goals, they are welcome to give a brief synopsis of it.

    If you’re having Java problems, this session’s speakers feel bad for
    you. You know the popular JVM languages, and maybe you’ve even tried
    them. But are you a black belt in Judo? Tried a hot cup of Ceylon?
    Looked in the Mirah? Welcomed back Kotlin? There are more than 250
    languages on the JVM, and the handful you know is just the beginning.
    This session takes a rapid, entertaining look at all the lesser-known
    JVM languages. All of them? Yes, all of them. The presentation spends
    more time on languages in active use and then quicken the pace in a
    survey of as many JVM languages as possible. If you’ve programmed in it,
    there’s a JVM version of it, and you’ll see it in this session.

    In this session, hear from a distinguished panel of industry and open
    source luminaries regarding where they believe the Java EE community is
    headed, starting with Java EE 7. The focus of Java EE 7 and 8 is mostly
    on the cloud, specifically aiming to bring platform as a service (PaaS)
    providers and application developers together so that portable
    applications can be deployed on any cloud infrastructure and reap all
    its benefits in terms of scalability, elasticity, multitenancy, and so
    on. Most importantly, Java EE will leverage the modularization work in
    the underlying Java SE platform. Java EE will, of course, also update
    itself for trends such as HTML5, caching, NoSQL, ployglot programming,
    map/reduce, JSON, REST, and improvements to existing core APIs.

    In modern development environments, it’s a must to include testing of
    Web applications as a standard part of the development lifecycle. Such
    tests can also be used as acceptance criteria in enterprise projects.
    Although full automation is possible, it is considered to be very
    expensive. As a result, in projects where testing is included as part of
    the project plan, it is also often the first requirement cut when the
    project schedule begins to slip. Learn more in this session.

    mines can be more than just a challenge. These also seem to be among the
    first areas glossed over by most projects. Why? Because dealing with
    them is hard! In this session, developers will get an understanding of
    these issues through examples and real-world use cases. It includes
    specific guidance for handling them and discusses how to work around
    current technical challenges and handle some special cases exclusive to

    Ceylon is a new programming language designed to execute on the JVM.
    This session’s speakers are fans of Java and its ecosystem, but they
    think the language and class libraries, designed more than 15 years ago,
    are no longer the best foundation for a range of today’s business
    computing problems, so they have proposed a new language that includes
    many improvements to Java while sticking to the Java philosophy that
    people love, which made it so popular. This session provides an
    introduction to Ceylon and shows you its main features and the ongoing
    progress of the compiler, IDE, and tools as well as the community behind
    it.
