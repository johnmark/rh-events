  The Fedora Project will be showcasing programming for open source
  hardware using Fedora at World Maker Faire 2012. Visit Ruth Suehle,
  Fedora Marketing Manager, and Tom "Spot" Callaway, Fedora Engineering
  Manager, at the Fedora exhibit to try out the the Raspberry Pi Photo
  Booth (#8919). You can get your photo taken with Tux, the penguin mascot
  of Linux, all from a photo booth built on a Raspberry Pi, Fedora 17, and
  a Python script controlling a DSLR camera.
