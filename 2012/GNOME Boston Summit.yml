  The Boston Summit is a three-day hackfest for GNOME developers and
  contributors. It is not primarily aimed at users or new contributors,
  but if you want to jump right into the deep end, it's a fantastic way to
  meet everyone and get involved. Unlike traditional conferences, the
  Boston Summit is all about getting developers together and getting
  things done. While there are some non-hacking sessions, they are geared
  heavily towards many-to-many, interactive discussion and planning,
  rather than one-to-many presentations. However, unlike previous years,
  there are plans to run in parallel a more newbie-oriented set of
  sessions, such as a basic Linux/GNOME "installfest" and help learning
  about GNOME application technologies.

  Many Red Hat employees who are contributors to GNOME will be in
  attendance. For more information, including an attendee list, [visit the
