    Almost a year ago the final WebSocket standard was adopted (RFC 6455).
    But what has been happening within the last year? What about the support
    of the new standards, especially in the context of the "Mobile Web"? The
    presentation gives an overview of the current state of the protocol and
    provides a variety of client and server libraries before using practical
    examples.

    examples, and real world use cases. How to handle current technical
    challenges and cases only found with mobile applications.
