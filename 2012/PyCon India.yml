    Django is a high-level Python based web framework that encourages rapid
    development and clean, pragmatic design.

    Django comes with it's very own templating layer, which is not merely
    python embedded into HTML, but it is a dumb python-like DSL which, by
    design, keeps programming logic out of the templates and keeps the
    presentation layer clean.

    In this talk, Shreyank will introduce the Django Template Language and
    cover most of the useful tags and filters. He will also explore how to
    write custom tags and filters. For more information, including speaker
