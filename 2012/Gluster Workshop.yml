name: Gluster Workshop
location: Barcelona, Spain
start: 2012-11-08
description: |
  GlusterFS is a community produced, open source, distributed file system
  capable of scaling to several petabytes(actually, 72 brontobytes!) and
  handling thousands of clients. The morning workshop sessions will
  provide attendees with a broad and deep overview of GlusterFS, from
  history and roadmap to the latest release, v 3.3. The afternoon
  sessionswill focus on Gluster implementation as a big data solution,
  development platform and tool for systems administrators.

    Now one year after the Red Hat acquisition of Gluster, Inc, the Gluster
    community is growing up. Every day, more users and developers come to
    appreciate the simplicity, ease of use, and flexibility of distributed
    data storage, GlusterFS style. In this talk, attendees will learn about
    the project's history, the most recent release, the in-process developer
    sprint, and what new features are just around the corner.

- title: Integrating GlusterFS, oVirt and KVM
  speaker: Vijay Bellur
  start: 2012-11-08 11:15 CET

    GlusterFS is a distributed file system that can scale to several
    PetaBytes. oVirt is a management platform for Kernel based Virtual
    Machine (KVM) and can be used to manage GlusterFS as well.

    This presentation will discuss integration of KVM and GlusterFS through
    various mechanisms like:

    * GlusterFS's FUSE based native protocol
    * Qemu and libglusterfsclient

    Details on how both file and block based interfaces can be presented to
    host KVM images from GlusterFS will be provided.

    The presentation will then talk about how oVirt can be used to provision
    GlusterFS volumes and how such volumes can then be used for hosting KVM
    images. Configuration details of both these features from oVirt would be
    presented.

    The benefits emerging from integration of these projects would be
    highlighted as well.

    Gluster's Unified File and Object (UFO) is a hybrid solution that allows
    you to access your existing data simultaneously via traditional
    filesystems and via the SWIFT API's. In this talk, we will go over the
    benefits of using UFO, as well as demonstrating common use cases for
    setting up object storage with Gluster.

- title: GlusterFS for SysAdmins
  speaker: Dustin Black
  start: 2012-11-08 15:30 CET

    GlusterFS represents a dramatic departure from traditional backend
    storage solutions. In this talk, attendees will get a technical dive
    into GlusterFS from the SysAdmin perspective, including a study of
    implementation scenarios. We'll explore such topics as enterprise
    storage strategy, data access methods, the elegant simplicity of scaling
    both out and up, the strength of redundancy and fault tolerance, and
    ways to boost performance.
