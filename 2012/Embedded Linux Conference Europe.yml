    The real-time patch (which provides CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT), has been around
    since 2005. Started by Ingo Molnar and maintained by Thomas Gleixner and
    several others, it has grown from a hobby RTOS into a very serious
    contender. Several distributions (Red Hat, SuSE, Debian, Ubuntu) supply
    a kernel version that includes this patch. The embedded world has
    started adding the -rt patch to their own devices that they ship. But do
    the embedded developers understand what the -rt patch supplies?
    Programming for real time, and especially when writing kernel code
    requires special knowledge to avoid real time traps. This talk will
    explain what the real time patch provides and special programming tips
    that will ensure embedded developers will get the best from their
    devices.
