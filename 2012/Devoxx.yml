- title: Write your first Ceylon program with the language authors
  speaker: Stephane Epardaud and Gavin King
  start: 2012-11-12 13:30 CET
  end: 2012-11-12 16:30 CET
  description: |
    During this session, Gavin King (author of Ceylon) and Stéphane Épardaud
    (Ceylon team) will help you learn the Ceylon programming language, hand
    in hand, from downloading the tools, using the IDE, getting to know the
    various tools, the language SDK, all the way to running your own module
    repository and publishing your first Ceylon modules to it and to the
    official Ceylon module repository.

    No knowledge of Ceylon required, though the audience should be familiar
    with the Java programming language.

- title: Raise Your Java EE 6 Productivity Bar with JBoss Forge
  speaker: Koen Aers
  start: 2012-11-12 18:05 CET

    Getting started with Java EE development can, despite the important
    improvements over time, still be quite daunting for newbies. Putting a
    JSF application to work, setting up persistence or enabling restful web
    services are not trivial tasks.

    JBoss Forge is a versatile and lean development environment entirely
    written in Java and making smart use of CDI. Its purpose is to offer you
    the possibility of incrementally working in new functionality into
    existing Java projects. It is a command-line oriented tool, so creating
    entities or scaffolding a user interface is just a matter of issuing a
    few commands.

    But what if your task cannot be done by Forge? No worries, as Forge
    operates by means of plug-ins, the answer is simply to look for an
    appropriate plugin or create it yourself if one is not available.

    Finally, Forge can also be integrated in graphical IDE's opening up all
    its power to users of common platforms such as Eclipse. Come to this
    session if you want to see this powerful tool live in action!

- title: OpenShift State of the Union
  speaker: Marco Rietveld
  start: 2012-11-13 14:00 CET
  end: 2012-11-13 15:00 CET
  description: |
    There are plenty of clouds and platform-as-a-services to choose from,
    but where to start?

    Join us for an action-packed hour of power where we'll show you how to
    deploy an application written in the language of your choice - Java,
    Ruby, PHP, Perl or Python, with the framework of your choice - EE6, CDI,
    Seam, Spring or Rails to the OpenShift PaaS in just minutes. All without
    having to rewrite your app to get it to work as the cloud provider
    thinks it should work.

    We will focus on examples that highlight what OpenShift has to offer,
    how to get started, & provide example projects that you can access now.
    Bring your laptop & follow along as we help you get started with
    Aerogears, Drools Planner, BRMS, Switchyard & much more. Real world
    projects put on display for you with code you can access live during
    this session.

    If you want to learn how the OpenShift PaaS & investing an hour of your
    time can change everything you thought you knew about developing apps in
    the cloud, this session is for you!

- title: Measuring performance and capacity planning in Java-based data grids
  speaker: Mircea Markus
  start: 2012-11-13 18:05 CET
  end: 2012-11-13 18:35 CET
  description: |
    Measuring your data grid's performance it's not a trivial task. In this
    presentation, Mircea Markus will introduce project Radargun: a
    benchmarking framework that helps measuring the performance and
    throughput of in-memory data grids. Radargun offers an simple and
    effective way to compare how various data grid products would behave
    based on a specific use case helping you to chose the one that fits your
    need. It also makes it a great tool setting up a prototyping your
    data-grid based application in a matter of minutes.

- title: Why JRuby and TorqueBox Belong in Your Java Tool Box
  speaker: Ben Browning
  start: 2012-11-12 19:00 CET
  end: 2012-11-12 20:00 CET
  description: |
    This session will briefly introduce you to JRuby and TorqueBox and the
    value they can bring to a Java organization. Then we'll open things up
    for discussion where participants can ask questions and share their
    experiences for the benefit of everyone. If your organization is
    considering deploying JRuby applications, you won't want to miss this!

- title: Maven dependency puzzlers
  speaker: Geoffrey de Smet
  start: 2012-11-13 17:25 CET
  end: 2012-11-13 17:55 CET
  description: |
    We release our dependency information as pom.xml files on a maven
    repository. But how well do we understand the effect of these pom.xml
    files on our users? What problems do we create in ours and their
    dependency resolution?

    In this session, you’ll be presented with several Maven puzzlers. Each
    Maven puzzler is a small POM configuration with a multiple-choice
    question about the output. Some puzzlers are easy, others are hard.
    Whoever answers most puzzlers correctly, wins.

- title: 'Bean Validation 1.1: its not Beansland anymore'
  speaker: Emmanuel Bernard
  start: 2012-11-15 10:50 CET
  end: 2012-11-15 11:50 CET
  description: |
    Bean Validation standardizes constraint declarations and validation for
    the Java platform.Bean Validation 1.0 has been widely adopted and
    seamlessly integrated with some other JSRs (like JSF, JPA) and the rich
    Java framework environment at large.

    We will explore what version 1.1 brings to the table and what new
    features you can expect for your future Java SE or EE applications. We
    will discuss in an example driven fashion method-level validation,
    Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) integration and many more new
    features and improvements.

    Come join us to see that Bean Validation is not Beansland anymore.

- title: The JBoss Polyglot Revolution - Be part of it!
  speaker: Galder Zamarreño
  start: 2012-11-15 10:50 CET
  end: 2012-11-15 11:50 CET
  description: |
    In this talk, Galder will look at the evolution of JBoss, from a
    producer of java based middleware, to the current expansion towards
    multi-language platforms. How did Torquebox come about? Why are we
    creating Ceylon? What is Escalante? What is Immutant? This and many
    other questions will be answered in this informal chat that will not
    only look into the motivations behind building middleware in other
    languages, but will also discuss the technological advances that have
    this expansion possible. During this presentation the audience will get
    invaluable feedback on the lessons learnt while developing with other
    languages, pitfalls of the different languages used, tips of learning
    new languages...etc, giving them first-hand advice that they will be
    able to apply in their work environments. Finally, the talk will finish
    with information on how join and contribute to the JBoss Polyglot
    Revolution!

- title: Practical guide to Infinispan Queries
  speaker: Sanne Grinovero
  start: 2012-11-15 13:10 CET
  end: 2012-11-15 13:25 CET
  description: |
    Infinispan is a powerful and extremely efficient transactional NoSQL: a
    distributed in-memory Data Grid exposing primarily a Map-like API, but
    also integrating Apache Lucene to allow full-text queries. This
    integration however can be setup in a number of ways, resulting in
    different architectures.

    How to pick the right clustering mode? Which indexing backend to choose?
    Should you use a shared CacheLoader?

    Let’s explore these options via some practical examples.

    What if somebody told you that you have to reverse engineer a database
    and to create a JSF application with CRUD operations for it? What if he
    adds that he needs this application deployed in the cloud and that
    moreover you only have 15 minutes to achieve this? Wouldn't you think
    this person is out of his mind? During this quickie we will show you how
    to do this using JBoss Forge.
